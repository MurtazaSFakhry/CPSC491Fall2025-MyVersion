{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "On January 26, 2024, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a report and order, which adopted rules to increase the precision of routing wireless 9-1-1 calls to Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs). Historically, these calls have been sent to PSAPs simply based on the location of the cell tower that takes the call. This process caused problems when a 9-1-1 call was made from Jurisdiction A, but the nearest cell tower is located in Jurisdiction B; this situation would require PSAPs to transfer the 9-1-1 call among themselves to find the correct jurisdiction. It takes time and resources to make these transfers, leading to increased response times and increased harm to those in need of emergency services. In an extreme example, a six-year-old boy drowned in July 2022, when a 9-1-1 call originating in Missouri was mistakenly routed to Colorado."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The FCC has implemented new rules for wireless providers to utilize technology that supports location-based routing. This approach ensures the caller's IP-network offers a more precise location, so the correct PSAP receives the call directly. The anticipated cost for this program could be up to $215 million, but the expected benefit, in reducing PSAP transfer time and preventing delays that could result in fatalities, is valued at $173 billion."}]}

National wireless providers must implement these programs for wireless calls by November 13, 2024, and extend them for real-time texts by May 13, 2026. Meanwhile, non-national providers have until May 13, 2026, for both calls and texts to be compliant."}]}
