{"role": "user", "content": "Are there differences between emergency alerting and 911 that require changes to the risk management plan? What about the benefits and costs of certification for services supporting 911 calling?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, there are indeed differences between emergency alerting and 911 services that might necessitate adjustments in risk management plans. While both are critical to public safety, emergency alerting, such as Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), broadly disseminates urgent information, whereas 911 services are direct calls for immediate assistance. This distinction in function and delivery could impact the risk factors and management strategies. \n\nFor instance, the risk of false alerts in emergency alerting systems like WEA can have massive repercussions, leading to public panic or loss of trust, as seen in the 2018 Hawaii missile alert incident. Risk management plans must, therefore, focus on robust verification processes and infrastructure resilience to prevent such occurrences. Meanwhile, 911 services focus more on reliability and immediate accessibility, requiring measures against network failures.\n\nAs for certification, while it incurs costs, the benefits often outweigh them by ensuring system reliability and public trust. For services supporting 911 calling, the certification process verifies that all components meet rigorous standards, providing assurance in critical situations. Each system's unique requirements in terms of security and functionality would dictate specific risk management and certification priorities."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What measures should be taken to ensure mobile devices only display valid WEA messages?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "To ensure mobile devices display only valid WEA messages, it is crucial to enhance the authentication protocols between CMS Providers and mobile devices. Here are some proposed measures:\n\n1. **Enhanced Authentication Protocols:** Providers should transmit comprehensive authentication data to enable mobile devices to verify the authenticity of base stations. This can be achieved by incorporating additional layers of handshake protocols that confirm the base station's validity before any alert is displayed.\n\n2. **Regular Firmware Updates:** Mobile devices should receive regular updates to ensure the latest security protocols are in place, minimizing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by bad actors.\n\n3. **Real-time Monitoring and Alerts:** Implement systems that can detect and alert any abnormal activities or unauthorized attempts to broadcast messages through the network. Immediate detection and response can help mitigate the impact of false alerts.\n\n4. **User Education and Awareness:** Educating users on recognizing legitimate alerts and providing a mechanism for reporting suspected false alerts can add an additional layer of community-level scrutiny and immediate feedback.\n\nBy implementing these enhancements, the integrity and reliability of WEA messages received by the public can be significantly improved, thereby maintaining trust and preventing unnecessary panic."}

{"role": "user", "content": "How can mobile devices authenticate alerts or base stations in the Wireless Emergency Alert system?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Mobile devices can authenticate alerts or base stations by transmitting sufficient authentication information. For instance, Participating CMS Providers can provide for the authentication of base stations using unique identifiers or encryption keys. This involves uniquely identifying legitimate base stations through a selection of base station characteristics to defend against denial-of-service attacks and fraud, potentially leveraging base station fingerprinting. Additionally, WEA-capable mobile devices can receive encryption keys from the network, which can be used to confirm the authenticity of alerts or base stations."}

{"role": "user", "content": "What are the trade-offs with technological approaches to preventing false alerts?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "One of the trade-offs involves the compatibility of non-service initialized or SIM-less WEA-capable devices with these authentication solutions. The effectiveness of these solutions might vary depending on the handset technology or the wireless network generation being used. Refining proposed rules could help mitigate these challenges. However, the implementation of these solutions might still allow false alerts under certain conditions, so ongoing evaluation and adjustments would be necessary to minimize such risks."}

This includes approximately $814,000 to update the standards and about $13.7 million for software updates. The costs were calculated based on the annual compensation of network engineers and software developers, including their benefits, for the time required to develop and implement these updates."}
```
```jsonl
{"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."}
{"role": "user", "content": "We quantify the cost of modifying software as the annual compensation for a software developer compensated at the national average for their field ($120,990/year), plus annual benefits ($60,495/year) working for the amount of time that it takes to develop software (one year) at each of the 76 CMS Providers that participate in WEA. We seek comment on these cost estimates."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The estimated cost is based on the computation of $120,650 in salary plus $60,325 in benefits, multiplied by the 76 CMS Providers, resulting in a total of $13,754,100, rounded to $13.7 million.

Moreover, a \"small organization\" is any not-for-profit enterprise that is independently owned and not dominant in its field, often with annual revenue of $50,000 or less."}]}

A very small business is similarly defined but with average gross revenues not exceeding $20 million for the same period. These size standards are important in the context of bidding for licenses, such as those for Broadband Radio Service (BRS), as they determine eligibility for small business status. However, the number of winning bidders classified as small businesses at the end of an auction doesn't necessarily correspond to the number of small businesses currently operating, as the Commission doesn't generally track business sizes post-auction unless specific issues, such as unjust enrichment, arise."}
