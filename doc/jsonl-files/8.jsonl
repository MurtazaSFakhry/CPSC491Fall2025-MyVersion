Cyber crisis management in the EU presents several complexities. A key challenge is the subjectivity involved in defining what constitutes a cyber crisis. Elevating a cyber incident to the level of a crisis generally requires a political decision and is influenced by the 'risk appetite' of EU Member States (MS), indicating how much risk they are willing to tolerate. Variations in interpretation among MS create difficulties at the EU level. The definition of a cyber crisis is crucial as it affects the entire management approach, from assessing its severity to choosing suitable measures for its management. Effective crisis management involves various stakeholders working at organizational, sectoral, regional, national, and EU levels, operating at strategic, operational, and technical levels. The operational level is vital as it links the strategic and technical levels by ensuring information flows across all levels."}]}

The perception of a crisis is influenced by political and organizational factors, making it a subjective interpretation rather than an absolute truth.\n\nThe Report on Cyber Crisis Cooperation and Management highlights that escalation to crisis status is subjective; political and organizational perceptions can 'create' a crisis. Consequently, what may be a crisis for one actor might be routine for another, adding a degree of subjectivity to this escalation process. \n\nWhen an incident exceeds a certain threshold of risk tolerance, it can no longer be managed with standard means and thus is declared a crisis.

This approach is bolstered by a legislative framework that aims to ensure member states meet minimum cybersecurity resilience standards, including the enhancement of crisis management capabilities. Notable legislative frameworks include the NIS Directive, the Cybersecurity Act, and the more recent NIS2, which focuses on clearer responsibilities, improved planning, and enhanced response strategies for large-scale cybersecurity incidents."}]}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "A crisis communication strategy is crucial for delivering a clear and timely message, especially in the cyber domain where proactive communication can prevent public doubt. The key is to have a competent unit or department responsible for coordinating the timing and content of messages. This ensures a unified and coherent discourse. Communicators should be technically savvy to translate complex cyber issues into understandable information for the public. It's vital that roles are clearly defined in advance to streamline communication tasks across government levels. Effective response to both internal and external information requests is critical, with the ultimate aim being to inform the public responsibly and accurately."}

Given the potentially large number of organisations affected during a cyber crisis, the mobilisation of these partners would relieve national cyber crisis management authorities which, if they lack the resources to act on all fronts, could concentrate on other tasks with higher added value. Certified trusted security incident response service providers, approved in advance and compliant with high-level requirements, could be called on directly by an essential entity. To provide an overview of the market for these approved providers, the MS competent authority could publish a directory, enabling the appropriate partner to be found quickly in case of emergency. This list could briefly present certified trusted security service providers, their contact details and their performance characteristics, allowing for a kind of pre-approved, trusted pool of experts. In order to avoid time-consuming research when responding to a cyber crisis, the MS national cyber crisis management authority could ensure that all essential entities have contracted a partnership with a certified trusted security service provider.
