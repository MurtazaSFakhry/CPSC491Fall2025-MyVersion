{"role": "assistant", "content": "On September 26, 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall near Perry, Florida, causing significant damage to personal property and critical infrastructure, including communication networks. The impact spread across Florida, Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, and Virginia. A week after the storm, some counties continued to experience cell site outages despite repairs in many areas."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What are some of the challenges faced in restoring cell services after Hurricane Helene?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The challenges in restoring cell services included damaged infrastructure like roads, which inhibited access to cell sites, damage to cell towers and fiber lines connecting the sites to networks, and a lack of power to cell sites, which hindered permanent restoration efforts."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What role does the federal government have in restoring cell services after such disasters?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "While wireless networks are privately owned and network owners are responsible for repairs, the federal government, through FEMA, may deploy communication assets to support restoration efforts when authorized."}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does the FCC assist during disasters?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The FCC monitors the status of commercial networks and provides updates to government officials and the public on the communications network status, outages, and restoration efforts. It requires providers to report on their network status during disasters through systems like the Disaster Information Reporting System (DIRS)."}]}
```
```jsonl
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the Disaster Information Reporting System?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DIRS is a web-based system that allows providers to report their network status during disasters. The FCC activates DIRS in anticipation of or in response to disasters and announces this through public notices and emails. Providers are required to submit daily reports on network status, and the data is shared with federal emergency management officials, designated state agencies, and other government bodies involved in public safety. The FCC also publishes aggregated outage data for public access."}]}

The activation was for select counties in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. This required providers to report outages and enable roaming across networks, coordinate with each other and with state and local agencies, and keep stakeholders and consumers informed of status and restoration efforts."}, {"role": "user", "content": "What actions did private telecommunication providers take in preparation for Hurricane Helene?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Private telecommunication providers like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile took several actions to prepare for the hurricane. They fortified their networks by refueling generators and providing backup batteries at cell sites and switching centers. Additionally, they prepositioned mobile assets such as satellite cells on light trucks and wheels, and deployed teams to the region. These providers coordinated with state and local governments and their public safety customers, and were ready to receive requests for assistance. They also prepared and pre-staged equipment for deployment and offered preparedness guidance to consumers."}]}

In the past, Members have been interested in expanding outage reporting to include broadband outages (H.R. 8178, 117th Congress), and the FCC has sought comment on the issue. Congress may consider changes to outage reporting. Previous Congresses also have considered legislation to improve resiliency and redundancy of cell networks by mandating or subsidizing backup power to each cell site (S. 1506, 117th Congress). While such investments could strengthen resiliency, provision of backup power sources could increase costs for providers and consumers. Finally, Congress could consider advantages and disadvantages of expanded use of and federal support for advanced technologies, including drones and satellite technologies in rural regions to support communications."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Congress has various options to enhance telecommunications resilience during emergencies. Implementing strategies from past hurricanes, such as Helene, could improve preparedness and coordination efforts. Additionally, expanding outage reporting to cover broadband could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of service gaps during emergencies. However, lawmakers would need to weigh the benefits of subsidizing backup power for cell sites against the potential cost implications for providers and consumers. Advanced technologies like drones and satellites could also offer significant advantages in improving communication infrastructures in rural areas, but these require careful consideration and potential federal support."}]}
