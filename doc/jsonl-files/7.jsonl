These barriers can exacerbate the risks they face by making it difficult to understand evacuation notices and emergency instructions, thereby increasing the risk of casualty. Moreover, language barriers may impede access to emergency medical care and essential relief services as they might not understand the providers. Additionally, complexities arise when applying for federal aid due to difficulties in understanding applications, guidance, and instructions, potentially delaying or deterring them from seeking help, or resulting in insufficient aid awards. While FEMA provides assistance in English and Spanish and can contract for other languages, inconsistencies in translations can further hinder effective communication. Understanding these challenges is crucial for improving the delivery of assistance to individuals with LEP."}]}

Additionally, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act requires regulations ensuring non-discrimination in disaster relief based on English proficiency. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 further obliges the FEMA Administrator to collaborate with state, local, tribal, and territorial governments (SLTTs) to identify LEP populations, ensure their inclusion in disaster planning, provide access to disaster relief information, and maintain a database of successful language assistance programs for SLTT use during incidents."}]}

Specifically, the FCC mandates that EAS broadcasters providing foreign language programming must transmit EAS announcements in the primary language of the EAS participant. Additionally, FCC rules require EAS participants to report actions taken to reach non-English-speaking audiences. The FCC also adopted WEA rules requiring wireless service providers to transmit WEA alerts in Spanish or containing Spanish-language characters if users specify Spanish as their preferred language."}]}

In February 2023, 45 Members from both chambers of Congress signed a letter urging the FCC to expand the number of WEA languages.

These factors are:\n1. The number or proportion of individuals with LEP served or encountered in the service population.\n2. The frequency of contact with individuals with LEP.\n3. The nature and importance of the program.\n4. The agency’s available resources."}

This plan outlines how FEMA assesses the needs of individuals with Limited English Proficiency (LEP) during disaster situations, providing information and interpreter services in up to 69 languages. Despite these efforts, challenges remain in trust-building with LEP individuals due to language barriers and concerns over immigration surveillance. Additionally, FEMA has experienced gaps in their bilingual workforce, as demonstrated during Hurricane María when there was a lack of Spanish-speaking staff in Puerto Rico. There is a noted need for increased appropriations to support hiring more bilingual staff and improving translation accuracy."}]}
