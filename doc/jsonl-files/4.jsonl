The federal government has developed an IP-based national alerting system that enables authorized agencies to send alerts through multiple channels. Additionally, there is an investment in FirstNet, a nationwide seamless, IP-based, high-speed mobile communications network that enhances communication among public safety agencies. Furthermore, there is an interest in upgrading 911 systems to next-generation IP-based systems to facilitate data sharing and system interconnection."}]}

Advancements in geolocation technologies make it easier to locate 911 callers, though integrating these into legacy systems can be difficult. While advancements in alerting help officials send alerts to mobile phones more effectively, some individuals still depend on landline phones for communication. Interconnecting systems can improve information sharing but also poses challenges regarding privacy and data security across multiple networks. Furthermore, the creation of nationwide systems may necessitate new policies for integrating new technologies, collaborative planning, and cross-governmental training. The migration to new technologies is expensive, and not all jurisdictions may be able to afford the costs."}]}
