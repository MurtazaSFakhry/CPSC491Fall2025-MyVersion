These alerts notify the public about imminent threats to safety, such as dangerous weather or missing persons. Government officials can target specific geographic areas, like lower Manhattan in New York, to ensure that only those in the affected area receive the alert. Established by the Warning, Alert and Response Network (WARN) Act in 2008 and operational since 2012, WEA is a collaborative effort involving the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the FCC, and the U.S. wireless industry. Participation is voluntary for wireless companies."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "How does WEA work?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Authorized national, state or local government authorities send alerts regarding public safety emergencies such as severe weather, missing children, or the need to evacuate using WEA. Authorized public safety officials send WEA alerts through FEMA's Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) to participating wireless carriers, which then push the alerts to compatible mobile devices in the affected area."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Who receives the alerts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The alerts are broadcast to the geographic area affected by an emergency. This means that if an alert is sent to a zone in New York, WEA-capable mobile devices in that zone can receive the alert, even if they are roaming or visiting from another state. In other words, a customer visiting from Chicago would be able to receive alerts in New York so long as the person has a WEA-enabled mobile device in the alert zone."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Do consumers have to sign up to receive alerts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Consumers do not need to sign up for this service. WEA allows government officials to send emergency alerts to all subscribers with WEA-capable devices if their wireless carrier participates in the program."}]}

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Are consumers able to receive WEAs on a prepaid phone?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes.

{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Do consumers need a new phone or a smart phone to receive alerts?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Consumers should check with their wireless carrier regarding the availability of WEA-capable handsets. In addition, CTIA, a wireless trade association, publishes lists of WEA-capable phones offered by the largest wireless providers."}]}
{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Is WEA available everywhere?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Participation in WEA by wireless carriers is widespread but voluntary. Some carriers may offer WEA over all or parts of their service areas or over all or only some of their wireless devices. Other carriers may not offer WEA at all. Even if you have a WEA-enabled device, you would not receive WEAs in a service area where the provider is not offering WEA or if your device is roaming on a provider network that does not support the WEA service. Consumers should check with their wireless carriers to determine the extent to which they are offering WEA."}]}

When the WEA program launched, participating wireless providers were generally required to send the alerts to a geographic area no larger than the county or counties affected by the emergency. Next, beginning in 2017, participating wireless providers were required to transmit alerts to a geographic area that best approximated the area affected by the emergency, even if it was smaller than a county. Now, as of December 2019, participating wireless providers must geographically target alerts to technologically compatible phones even more: they must deliver the alerts to the area specified by the alert originator with no more than a 1/10 of a mile overshoot."}]}
