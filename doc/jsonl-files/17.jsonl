{"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has clarified the interaction between the Emergency Connectivity Fund (ECF) and the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA). Internet access or services acquired through the ECF, intended solely for use with student-, school staff-, or patron-owned computers, are not subject to CIPA. This is because the Emergency Connectivity Fund support is provided under the authority of section 254(h)(1)(B) and (2) of the Communications Act, as stipulated by section 7402(a) of the American Rescue Plan. CIPA, part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, mandates certain Internet safety measures, like technology protection measures, for schools and libraries receiving E-Rate funding for connected computers. Some stakeholders support applying CIPA to the ECF program, while others highlight potential compliance challenges when applicants, such as schools, do not control the devices directly. Despite these challenges, FCC has maintained that CIPA is relevant to Emergency Connectivity Fund allocations."}

Jordyn, who transferred schools during the pandemic, described his struggles with online school. Jordyn’s family does not have internet access at home, and he can only participate in virtual classes by using his mother’s cellphone. But his mother works night shifts as a security guard at a casino and, like most of us, takes her phone with her. Ms. Coleman has difficulty making it home in time for Jordyn’s first morning classes due to her 40-mile commute on public transportation. Consistently connecting to online lessons would no doubt be easier with a home Wi-Fi connection.
