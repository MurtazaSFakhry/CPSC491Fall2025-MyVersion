{"role": "user", "content": "What happened with the recent CrowdStrike update?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "On July 19, 2024, CrowdStrike, a U.S. cybersecurity firm, released a software update that inadvertently caused certain systems to crash. This disrupted services across industries such as airlines, banks, hospitals, government agencies, and public safety systems. The issue stemmed from a defect in a content update on Microsoft Windows operating systems and was not due to a cyberattack."}
{"role": "user", "content": "How did this incident affect public safety systems?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Public safety agencies using CrowdStrike's cybersecurity software experienced significant disruptions. This included some 911 systems, police and fire agency systems, and other networks integral to emergency alerting. The incident also affected federal agencies supporting public safety and emergency response operations."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Can you give an example of how specific areas were impacted?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "In Phoenix, AZ, the police department reported that their computerized 911 dispatch system was affected by the CrowdStrike update. While the 911 centers could receive voice calls, their computer systems were not operational, impacting their ability to dispatch services efficiently."}

{"role": "user", "content": "What were the impacts of the system outage on public safety departments?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The system outage had various impacts on public safety departments across different locations:\n\n- In Phoenix, AZ, the police department's 911 dispatch center was affected, causing a manual recording of caller information instead of using the computerized system.\n- In Portland, OR, the city's Bureau of Emergency Communication had to take calls manually for their 911 center due to the affected CAD system.\n- In Alaska, state troopers announced issues with 911 systems and provided alternative phone numbers.\n- In Middletown, OH, the police issued a notice about their inability to receive 911 calls, offering alternative numbers.\n\nSome jurisdictions did not report impacts on their 911 services, while other areas experienced issues beyond 911:\n\n- In Columbus, OH, police could not access data from vehicle terminals, affecting law enforcement data and license plate information, and firefighters couldn't receive dispatch information in vehicles.\n- In Ocean City, MD, fire alarms that contact the fire department automatically were reportedly affected.\n\nFederal support agencies like the Department of Homeland Security experienced login difficulties on desktop computers but managed to work around them."}

For example, Next Generation 911 (NG911) implements advanced features like text-to-911 and multimedia communications, which enhance call routing and location-finding capabilities. This interconnectivity increases redundancy and resiliency but also introduces new vulnerabilities, including increased cyber risks. Organizations often manage these risks internally or by using third-party vendors like CrowdStrike to protect their systems."}]}

{"role": "user", "content": "Can you explain the potential risks associated with relying on third-party vendors for IT services, particularly in critical areas?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly. Depending on third-party vendors for critical IT services can introduce risks such as outages that affect multiple entities simultaneously. For example, if a vendor like CrowdStrike, a global cybersecurity firm, experiences an outage or releases a software update, it could impact not only general services but also crucial public safety systems. This highlights the importance of having robust backup protocols to maintain service continuity during such disruptions."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What steps did the Executive Branch take in response to the CrowdStrike incident?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The Executive Branch, including the White House and DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), assessed the impact on federal IT, critical infrastructure, and public safety systems. CISA worked closely with CrowdStrike and other partners, including federal, state, local, tribal, territorial entities, and international allies, to evaluate impacts and support remediation. The FCC also collaborated with federal agencies to address disruptions and assess their impact on vital services like 911 systems."}
