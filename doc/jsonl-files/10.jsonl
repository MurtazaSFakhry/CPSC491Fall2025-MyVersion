{"role": "user", "content": "Good morning. The subcommittee will come to order."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Good morning and welcome to today's oversight hearing of the Federal Communications Commission. This is the third time we have had the FCC before us this Congress, and I am pleased that we are maintaining a cadence of consistent oversight hearings."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Thank you. Can you state if there are any condolences to offer?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "I want to start by once again offering our condolences to the chairwoman for the loss and passing of her father. We hope that memories of him have helped her cope during this very difficult time. Although we can disagree on policy, we can come together to share each other's grief. On behalf of the committee, we are very sorry for his passing."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What were the main topics addressed in the last FCC hearing?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The last time the FCC was before us, we discussed its role in President Biden's broadband takeover and its overregulation of the communications industry. Unfortunately, the agency has continued down this path."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What actions has the FCC taken regarding broadband?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Earlier this year, the FCC voted to reclassify broadband as a common carrier under Title II of the Communications Act under the guise of net neutrality. This action expands the FCC's authority over broadband, allowing the agency to impose burdensome regulations that will make it harder for proprietors to deploy broadband."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Do you find these actions necessary?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "As I stated before, this action is absolutely unnecessary. In 2017, after the FCC reversed the Obama FCC's re-classification of broadband, the Democrats told the world that we would get the internet one word at a time and that the internet as we knew it would end. As we all know, none of these fears came true. In fact, the day after the order was rescinded, I asked my office to keep track of how many of my constituents experienced issues, and none were reported."}
```
```jsonl
{"role": "user", "content": "I have many concerns about the recent actions taken by the FCC regarding net neutrality. How do they affect internet providers and consumers?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The recent actions by the FCC to reimpose certain regulations are seen by some as a hindrance to U.S. leadership in broadband technology. Providers argue that these actions make it more challenging and expensive to deploy broadband services, ultimately impacting consumers by potentially increasing costs and limiting access. They believe that a light-touch regulatory framework had previously encouraged investment and improved service by allowing companies more flexibility."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What's an example of how U.S. networks have succeeded compared to other regions?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. broadband networks were able to handle increased usage as many aspects of daily life moved online. In contrast, European regulators had to request that websites like YouTube and Netflix throttle their services to manage demand. This indicates that U.S. networks were more robust, which some attribute to fewer regulatory constraints that encouraged private investment and infrastructure development."}
{"role": "user", "content": "How are States involved in net neutrality, and what has been their impact?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "While some States have enacted their own net neutrality policies, this wasn't a significant factor in maintaining the stability of the internet post-repeal by the FCC. Very few States enacted regulations, and none came close to the comprehensive utility-style regulations that had been repealed. The general consensus, according to some stakeholders, is that the lack of heavy-handed regulation allowed for better network performance and continued investment in broadband technology."}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Good morning. Bridging the digital divide is indeed crucial, and it's important for the FTC to collaborate effectively in this effort. Addressing the digital divide can help ensure equitable access to technology and the internet for all citizens."}
{"role": "user", "content": "But unfortunately, the FCC has been failing in its mission. The commission's recent action to reclassify broadband internet access as a public utility under Title II of the Communications Act, as well as the agency's broad rules on digital discrimination have undermined our efforts to ensure every American has access to broadband."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "It's challenging when regulatory actions appear to counteract efforts to improve broadband access. The reclassification under Title II and rules on digital discrimination aim to ensure fairness but can indeed affect the deployment and operation of broadband networks. Finding the right balance in regulation is crucial to expanding access without stifling innovation or investment."}
{"role": "user", "content": "This could not come at a worse time. We are on the verge of closing the digital divide. Congress has dedicated billions of dollars to achieve this effort, including $42 billion for the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program at the National Telecommunications and Information Agency."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The investment of billions in programs like the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment Program shows a strong commitment from Congress to close the digital divide. It's important to ensure that regulatory frameworks complement these investments to maximize their impact and achieve widespread broadband access."}

Such regulations are often argued to protect consumers from harmful practices by ISPs, but these claims lack substantial evidence. Our networks have shown incredible performance, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, with increased speeds, investments, and lower consumer prices. The anticipated detrimental effects like traffic throttling and fast lane blocking have not materialized in a light-touch regulatory environment. Reclassifying broadband under Title II is both bad policy and unlawful, as confirmed by the Supreme Court, emphasizing that such regulatory decisions require clear congressional authorization. The FCC should not overreach by claiming national security necessity to impose regulations. Recent legislative actions on related issues like the TikTok legislation demonstrate the necessity for congressional decision-making on significant economic and political matters."}]}

We are here today conducting important oversight of the Federal Communications Commission and its budget for the upcoming year. We commend the FCC under the leadership of Chairwoman Rosenworcel for putting the American people at the heart of every decision it has made over the last 3 years."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The FCC has consistently prioritized work to protect consumers, promote public safety, and enhance national security in our communications sector, leading the way towards a digital future that is safe and secure for all Americans. Nowhere has this been more apparent than in the FCC's adoption of net neutrality protections. This action corrected the Trump era FCC's misguided rollback of commonsense rules for an open internet. We strongly support the reinstatement of this authority."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The agency rectified a massive dereliction of its duty and extended bedrock consumer protections to broadband internet access that our nation has always applied to communication services. The FCC's actions will result in greater oversight over internet providers to mitigate network outages, resolve broadband consumer complaints, prevent anti-consumer and anti-competitive practices, and protect our national security."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The FCC is also playing a major role in the implementation of the broadband investments President Biden and congressional Democrats delivered as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

This approached requirement will help viewers better understand how political campaigns are attempting to influence them. We appreciate the chairwoman's efforts on the subject and will continue to support efforts to increase transparency around campaign ads and the use of AI finally."}
{"role": "user", "content": "Finally, there is increasing concern about extreme and Republican efforts to destroy agencies like the FCC and the important role it plays on behalf of the public in overseeing critical services like our communication networks. These Republican attacks against our Federal agencies would be devastating for consumers and would only help powerful companies to increase their profits even more. Trump's Project 2025 plan, authored in part by a Republican commissioner before us today would exasperate these consumer harms by eliminating expert agencies, gutting the civil service and consolidating power under the President. This will have serious negative consequences for Americans, leading to higher prices, lower quality services, and decreased safety and security. We simply cannot allow that to happen.

Firstly, they've established the Affordable Connectivity Program to provide broadband access across the nation, with 23 million households already benefiting from it. However, funding for the program ended in May, and they're urging Congress to continue support.\n\nSecondly, to protect consumers and enhance competition, the FCC reinstated net neutrality in April. This ensures that all consumers have internet access that is fast, open, and fair. They've also introduced new broadband nutrition labels, allowing consumers to compare service plans easily.\n\nThirdly, the FCC launched the U.S. Cyber Trust Mark to give consumers confidence in Internet of Things devices. They are also proposing a vote to allow wireless phones to be unlocked so that consumers can use them with any carrier, advocating for consumer freedom.\n\nAdditionally, the FCC created the National Broadband Map, the most accurate data representing current broadband access. They require continued funding for the Broadband DATA Act to maintain this tool, which ensures accountability in broadband spending.\n\nMoreover, the FCC is focused on making connectivity more accessible. Last year, they initiated proceedings to make video conferencing services accessible to people with disabilities. They also improved wireless emergency alerts to be available in multiple languages.\n\nFinally, the FCC is implementing measures to connect the most vulnerable members of society, although details on these initiatives weren't fully covered in the transcript segment."}]}

The FCC is implementing the Safe Connections Act to aid domestic violence survivors in obtaining secure communications. They're also working on adding a missing and endangered persons code for emergency alerts, which is especially beneficial for Tribal communities. \n3. Efforts are underway to reduce phone call rates for incarcerated individuals through the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act. \n4. The FCC has revoked telecommunications authorizations for four Chinese companies and is removing Huawei and ZTE equipment to secure communications. \n5. They're addressing internet routing vulnerabilities in partnership with DOJ, DHS, and DOD. \n6. The FCC is tackling scam robocalls and texts, with substantial fines issued and collaborations with State Attorneys General. More congressional authority is needed to further address this.\n7.

In response, we created the Space Bureau, streamlined satellite processing, freed spectrum for commercial space launches, and established a first-of-its-kind in the world framework for the coming convergence of satellite and terrestrial services, we call it the single network future. And last but not least, the FCC is working to free up more spectrum for 5G, 6G, and beyond. But to do this, we need Congress to restore the agency's action authority. For the first time in 3 decades, we do not have it. Restoring this authority will provide the United States with the strongest foundation to compete in a global economy, counter our adversaries' technology ambitions, and safeguard our national security. And using this authority, we won an Emmy award, bring it back and let's see what we can do with it next. So those are some of the things that the FCC is doing to build a digital future that works for everyone. I look forward to answering any questions you may have."}

We have made real progress in closing that digital device through ACP and we cannot afford to let it slide backwards. And so I look forward to working with those of you on this committee as you reconsider funding this critical program. Making sure that broadband is affordable is just 1 piece of puzzle. We also need to make sure that it was safe and secure so in April we reclassified broadband internet access under Title II of the Communications Act, a service that vitally needs oversight. I remain concerned as well about the threats to our Nation's networks, but I am confident that the FCC's recent bipartisan actions will help protect them.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has recently taken bipartisan actions to enhance network security. They approved a proposal requiring Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to implement security risk management plans for their use of the Border Gateway Protocol. This aims to protect and securely route Americans' data. Furthermore, it's vital to fully fund the Rip and Replace Program, which involves removing unsafe Chinese equipment from communication networks. This is crucial, especially for rural providers who support military installations and are at risk of shutdown without this funding. In addition, the FCC supports the emergency alert system to ensure Americans receive and act on emergency information promptly."}

Device security and technology evolution implicates all of the commission's core functions at a basic level, most specifically its authority over commercial spectrum. However, before I highlight these concerns, I must again express my frustration with the direction that the Commission has taken in dedicating its limited resources to implementation of partisan unnecessary and burdensome policy frameworks like the Title II broadband and digital discrimination regulatory regimes.

People from around the world could exchange services and ideas without restrictions, as there were no borders online. A website in the United States could be accessed from any other country just as well, albeit sometimes more slowly. Everyone was using similar devices and software, usually with no modification other than a local translation of the user interface.\n\nHowever, today we face the potential for foreign technology devices and services to act as vehicles for espionage and sabotage. It is difficult to trust non-trivial devices from certain countries, such as China, to be free from backdoors that could allow governmental access to data, control over the device, or render it inoperative.\n\nThese concerns also extend to services storing data about Americans in adversary countries, or those that may easily fall under the influence of adversaries. Even seemingly benign foreign technologies can become significant security threats. It's crucial to approach device security with this modern perspective, recognizing the potential risks introduced by foreign technologies."}]}

{"role": "assistant", "content": "In the past 9 months, I have had the privilege of traveling across the country to meet with consumers, industry leaders, advocacy groups, and local elected officials. These meetings highlighted the importance of communication services in daily life and the FCC's mission to ensure these services are accessible to everyone. We know that high-speed internet service is no longer a luxury but a necessity. During a visit to the Orlando Veterans' Affairs Medical Center, I learned that 80 percent of medical treatments veterans use for recovery required a broadband connection. A veteran from Paralyzed Veterans of America told me that connectivity is essential for veterans, particularly veterans with disabilities, to obtain healthcare, job opportunities, and VA benefits. The importance of digital connectivity in the daily lives of Americans is what makes the funding lapse of the bipartisan Affordable Connectivity Program so concerning. As of June 1, when funding lapsed, 23 million households across the United States lost support for the connectivity they need for work, school, and healthcare. While some internet service providers have voluntarily stepped up to provide limited free or lower-cost service, these are temporary salves. In the absence of action, families will face rising bills and disconnections. I very much empathize because I have lived experience with having to choose between paying rent and paying my phone bill. The ACP is the most successful tool Congress has ever provided to close the digital divide. The ACP benefited every corner of the country and it connected communities."}

Commissioner Carr, this Democratic commission has unfortunately voted to once again reclassify broadband under Title II. Chairman Rosenworcel claims that the internet did not break when Title II was repealed in 2017 because States stepped in to enact their own net neutrality rules.

For one, the State laws didn't take effect for a number of years. For another, if the potential of State regulation was enough, then that undermines the need for the FCC to step in with heavy-handed rules. The reality is that we were told that repealing these rules in 2017 would be the end of the internet as we know it. Since then, speeds are up over fivefold, prices are down in real terms, millions of Americans were brought across the digital divide, and COVID-19 was the ultimate stress test with our right regulatory framework. Our network performed, whereas those in Europe, which had heavier-handed utility-style regulation, saw speed slowdowns quite dramatically. In fact, their regulators asked Netflix and YouTube to degrade the quality of the streams to prevent the continent's networks from breaking.

And what we are doing with georouting is just that. We are going to -- instead of using the area code, we would use the cell tower that is picking up the call to route to a crisis center. We have sent letters to carriers, we have done some testing, and we started a rulemaking to make sure we have technical standards.

I think we can all agree that broadband is an essential service, and we also have policies in place that prevent there from being exclusives in apartment buildings that lock up an apartment building so that folks can't get any other provider and benefit from competition. One-third of the people in this country live in apartment buildings or multiunit dwellings. That is a lot of people. But what we are finding now is they are bypassing those exclusive prohibitions and just baking it into the rent or assessment fees on each apartment and unit. And so what I have received as the chair of the agency are a lot of complaints from consumers who say, everyone else gets competition; why don't I get competition? Why do I have to pay for this service if I don't want to use it? So what we have proposed is a rulemaking to ask those questions, mindful that there are some constituents, including folks like the ones you described, who might like."}]}

And more broadly, I think if you look at this administration, it has fallen into a real deep malaise when it comes to one of these most important considerations for economic growth, which is wireless. Right now, we have no plan to turn things around. Even though we do have a lapsed general spectrum auction authority, we do have authority still to auction spectrum. In fact, just last week, the FCC missed a statutory deadline to auction 30 megahertz of spectrum because the Commerce Department, in 2022, failed to meet a 2015 era statutory deadline imposed by Congress for identifying that specific 30 megahertz. So not only do we not have auction authority, but the administration isn't taking the steps that would let us move forward with auctions even where we do still have authority."}

We are the first country in the world to take garbage unused spectrum and turn it into unlicensed airwaves which are used for WiFi.

{"role": "legislator", "content": "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you witnesses for being here today. You know, the First District of Tennessee is home to a large amount of Federal land, specifically the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Cherokee National Forest. Updating wireless internet infrastructure on Federal lands is currently bogged down in the red tape of NEPA and the National Historic Preservation Act. I can tell you firsthand, some of the most difficult places in my district to get quality service is going to be the Great Smoky Mountains and the Cherokee National Forest. And that is just hurting our communities. In February, I introduced the Wireless Broadband Competition and Efficient Deployment Act, which would roll back the red tape, keeping these communities on Federal lands from getting the infrastructure to stay connected. My question is for you, Commissioner Carr. How important is it for Congress to take an active role in turning down these barriers to broadband deployment like overburdensome and sometimes ridiculous permitting requirements?"}
{"role": "witness", "content": "Thanks, Congresswoman, for your leadership, particularly on Federal lands, where it simply takes too long and costs too much to build out. I was just on another national park myself last week, Shenandoah. And I had virtually no cell phone service. In fact, I had to climb this small little tower to get any service at all. I ended up climbing that mountain a lot, fairly addicted to the internet. And so I think we need to move forward with legislation and leadership that you are showing and generally taking a look at permitting reform. Look, we have been spending a lot of money, $800 billion, again by my count; $42 billion of that for broadband specifically. We need to make sure it’s being used effectively."}

Look, I think when you look at the CCP, they aren't just simply coming at us through one vector, even one technology vector. It is a 1,000 different things that they are doing to try to prod and exploit vulnerabilities. We have taken action on the device layer, Huawei, ZTE, at the carrier level, China Mobile, but there is more to do, including data centers as well. Your point about chips is exactly right, and I think that can help feed into our proposal to look at labs and certification bodies that are going to be reviewing the components to make sure that those labs are themselves trustworthy. But we need to sort of play defense across all of these different areas of technology, because we are getting prodded by the CCP across all of them."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mrs. Harshbarger.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Mr. Carr. One thing that we can do is complete our proceeding that is looking at these TCBs in labs. I think another step that I have called for is for the FCC to look at the entities we do regulate and prohibit them from interconnecting with insecure entities, including China Mobile and China Telecom, to the extent that they are not even offering necessarily Title I or Title II services. I think that is one thing that the FCC should be doing."}
{"role": "user", "content": "In the past year, the FCC has adopted rules governing broadband labels, digital discrimination, net neutrality, and data breaches.

{"role": "assistant", "content": "Mr. Carr. I think what people lose sight of is that the broadband builders in this country that are truly bridging the digital divide in rural communities, it is not these large corporate behemoths. In many cases, it is mom-and-pop operations, small 20-person operations, and they are confronting a regulatory onslaught from Washington. We need to sort of decrease that regulation and that will help unleash their ability to build. Look, they are already dealing with inflation, they are already dealing with high fuel prices. And on top of that we are raising the regulatory cost. Again, BEAD I think is a perfect example where the Biden administration is layering on all of these regulatory costs that Congress specifically either prohibited them from doing or didn’t authorize."}

I will start with your point about ACP and spending. The FCC conducted its own survey and found that out of this $17 billion, only 15 percent of respondents said they would lose internet service if the program expired. I believe as Congress looks into ACP, the focus should be on the 15 percent, or whatever number truly requires it, instead of pouring more money into the existing setup. \n\nAs for the BEAD initiative, despite the $42 billion promise to connect millions of Americans, 967 days have passed without any tangible progress, such as construction projects commencing. This delay is attributed to the additional red tape which has stalled progress rather than facilitating swift action to connect the nation."}]}

So the Universal Service Fund, of course, dates back to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, at a time when the landline market was a lot bigger than it is now. Thus, on the front end of contributions, it is very difficult to fund a growing program out of a shrinking base."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Now, if you look at what the landline network was supposed to do, universal service says it was supposed to connect all Americans in a single network. In fact, it was to be a network that was intercompatible with all the networks worldwide and, thus, it benefited from the network effects of scale. Today, the beneficiaries of the networks effects of scale are online companies primarily. So to put it another way, when Comcast gains a customer, it is not just Comcast; it is Google, it is Meta, it is Amazon. These are the companies that benefit even more from universal connectivity than individual network operators who do not have the same advantages of scale."}

The AI Task Force has examined this issue, emphasizing that it's more complex than just mandating a disclosure.

Certain uses, like editing a candidate's audio for clarity, could be harmless, while others are questionable and may demand disclosure or prohibition."},{"role":"user","content":"Indeed, I believe transparency is beneficial and necessary.

I think we are all capable of doing that, and I think that is what our proposal was designed to do."}
