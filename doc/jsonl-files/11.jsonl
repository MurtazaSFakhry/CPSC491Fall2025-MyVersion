We met or partially met sixty of our sixty-nine goals—an 87 percent success rate. In addition to our program goals, we embarked on an ambitious course of action to completely revise our Strategic Plan to ensure that our plan reflects the goals of a converging and increasingly global telecommunications industry. In redoing our plan, we reached out to industry, to state, regional, and local governments, to academe and consumer interest groups, and to our own employees to provide us with input into the plan. In August 1999, we issued a draft Strategic Plan that, I believe, provides measurable, results-oriented performance goals for the next five years."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Another notable achievement in Fiscal Year 1999 was the completion of our plan to consolidate our enforcement and consumer information activities. Historically, the FCC has been organized along the traditional lines of wire, wireless, satellite, broadcast and cable communications. This traditional structure no longer makes sense in an era when the lines dividing many communications service providers are blurring. Consolidation of our consumer information services will allow us to provide improved information services to consumers facing a bewildering choice of competing telecommunications services. Centralization of our enforcement activities will allow us to respond quickly and efficiently to questionable activities in an increasingly deregulated marketplace. Moreover, our consumer information and enforcement staff will share information that will enable us to spot trends and areas of consumer and industry concern."}]}

Can you share your thoughts on this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly, let's delve into it. There were several major challenges that could have potentially impeded our progress. Firstly, there was a multi-phased agency move that required us to maintain duplicate operations for a significant period. This logistical complexity especially strained our information technology resources.\n\nAdditionally, ensuring Year-2000 compliance for all our mission-critical automated processing systems was a monumental task. This involved extensive system reviews and testing to make sure everything was compliant by the end of 1999. To safeguard against potential issues, we also created a comprehensive Business Continuity and Contingency Plan for each system.\n\nMoreover, budget constraints in Fiscal Year 1999 meant we couldn't complete certain critical network upgrades and performance goals. However, we are determined to progress on these fronts in Fiscal Year 2000, subject to securing additional funding."}, {"role": "user", "content": "It seems like a lot of effort went into maintaining operational stability. Were there any specific areas where progress was made?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Absolutely, despite these challenges, we successfully met our customer Speed of Disposal processing goals within the Authorization of Service functional area. The commitment and resilience demonstrated by our team have been exemplary, and I look forward to receiving feedback on our Annual Performance Plan."}]}

{"role": "user", "content": "Review and analyze the authorization of service data and workload reports provided by the Bureaus and Offices."}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "We aimed to meet 90% of our customer Speed of Disposal processing goals. This goal was partially met as the majority of license applications in all services were processed within established timeframes. However, the services where goals were not met were affected by several challenges, including the development and implementation of new electronic filing systems, Y2K compliance issues, and the technological convergence that complicated traditional licensing processes. Additionally, agency-wide efforts to reduce backlogged applications played a role."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What measures were taken to address these challenges, and what progress is anticipated?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Performance measurement was conducted through an analysis of internal workload reports. We anticipate significant progress in meeting our processing goals in Fiscal Year 2000. To address the challenges, electronic filing capabilities were provided for the CCB, MMB, IB, WTB, and OET licensing systems. Our strategy includes integrating the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau's ten licensing systems into a single, unified database to improve the Speed of Disposal and public access to the status of license applications. Additionally, efforts were made to redesign and integrate 13 Mass Media Bureau databases and to implement fully automated Equipment Authorization and Experimental Radio Service licensing systems."}
{"role": "user", "content": "What was accomplished in Fiscal Year 1999 regarding these initiatives?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "In Fiscal Year 1999, we advanced our initiatives by continuing to implement electronic filing capabilities, including systems in the Common Carrier, International, Wireless Telecommunications Bureaus, and the Office of Engineering and Technology. The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau successfully deployed 7 out of 10 commercial wireless services as part of its Universal Service Licensing System."}

{"role": "user", "content": "What about the Mass Media Bureau's progress in electronic licensing?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "The Mass Media Bureau has developed electronic licensing capabilities for all of its services and licensing systems. However, access to the public was delayed due to Y2k preparation priorities and budgetary constraints. Full implementation of these systems is dependent on adequate funding in Fiscal Year 2000."}
{"role": "user", "content": "How do you measure performance for these implementations?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Performance is measured by the number of authorization systems reengineered, the number of electronic filing systems implemented, and the effect of both on our licensees. For example, common carrier Local Access Transport Area modifications are now immediately placed on public notice and accessible electronically through the Commission’s Digital Index, with a typical comment and reply period limited to 3 weeks. An order addressing these modifications is typically issued approximately 60 days from the date of original filing."}
{"role": "user", "content": "How is the process improved for telecommunications carriers to add or discontinue lines?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Telecommunications carriers seeking to add new or discontinue old lines can obtain authority under Section 214 with no regulatory delays. On June 30, 1999, a Report and Order revised Part 63 rules eliminating the requirement to file applications for entry authority. This also entails that applications for discontinuance are granted automatically. Since these rules were implemented, no entry applications have been filed, and all but two applications for discontinuance have been allowed to become effective automatically."}
