1I. SUMMARY
The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) Modernization Act requires the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) IPAWS Program Management Office to conduct 
tests of the public alert and warning system.1  On October 4, 2023, FEMA, in coordination with the 
Federal Communications Commission (Commission or FCC), conducted nationwide tests of Wireless 
Emergency Alerts (WEA) and the Emergency Alert System (EAS).2  The purpose of these tests was to 
ensure that WEA and EAS “continue to be effective means of warning the public about emergencies, 
particularly on the national level.”3  
The following report presents the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau’s (PSHSB) 
analysis of how the EAS and WEA performed during the nationwide test, based on the information we 
have available.4
WEA Performance
Based on stakeholders’ survey data shared with the Commission, most respondents reported 
successful receipt of the WEA test message.5  The test also highlighted areas where WEA delivery can be 
improved, such as ensuring more consistent delivery and resolving issues concerning alert message audio 
tone and vibration cadence. 
EAS Performance
The nationwide test demonstrated that the large majority of EAS Participants – radio and 
television stations, cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite (DBS), Satellite Digital Audio 
Radio Service (SDARS), digital audio broadcasting systems, and wireline video systems6 – reported 
successful receipt and retransmission of the nationwide test.  The test demonstrated that the national EAS 
distribution architecture is largely effective as designed.  As anticipated, the test also shed light on

included working with Georgia Tech’s Center for Advanced Communications Policy, which “assembled a 
nationwide panel of about 10,000 people with disabilities to learn more about whether they received the test, in what 
format, and their location, among other things, to better understand access challenges.”  See Georgia Tech, School of

2operational readiness failures that prevented some EAS Participants to receive and/or retransmit the test 
alert.  The overall results of the 2023 nationwide EAS test, based upon data collected from the FCC’s 
EAS Test Reporting System (ETRS) and outreach to FEMA and State Emergency Communication 
Committee (SECC) representatives, demonstrate the following:
•The test message was received by 96.6% of EAS Participants (increase from 89.3% in 2021).  
The overall retransmission success rate was 93.6% (increase from 87.1% in 2021).  This 
significant improvement is likely due to initiation of the 2023 test alert via Common Alerting 
Protocol (CAP), which introduced additional resiliency that was not available during the over-
the-air-only 2021 nationwide test.
•While test participants reported less than one-third as many performance complications as 
compared to 2021, more test participants reported equipment configuration issues and equipment 
failures.
•At the time of the test, approximately 23% of EAS equipment units representing over 4,500 EAS 
Participants, were either using outdated software or were using equipment that no longer 
supported regular software updates.  Test results demonstrated that fully up-to-date equipment 
had the highest receipt and retransmission rates (97% and 95%, respectively), whereas equipment 
with software that is no longer supported had the lowest receipt and retransmission rates (90% 
and 85%, respectively).
•Five of the six poorest-performing geographic regions were territories of the United States.  
These territories were the Northern Mariana Islands (20.0% retransmission success), Guam 
(33.3% retransmission success), American Samoa (66.7% retransmission success), the U.S. 
Virgin Islands (88.9% retransmission success), and Puerto Rico (89.7% retransmission success).
Based on these results, PSHSB recommends that the Commission adopt rules to improve the 
operational readiness of EAS Participants and Participating CMS Providers, as well as ensure that EAS 
Participants are installing software updates in a timely manner and have plans for replacing equipment 
that is no longer supported by the manufacturer.  PSHSB also recommends actions that EAS Participants 
and Participating Commercial Mobile Service Providers should take to improve the reliability and reach 
of WEA and the EAS, including in the territories of the United States.  PSHSB also recommends that 
Congress require all CMS Providers to support WEA.
II. BACKGROUND
WEA and EAS are invaluable communications alerting tools.  They provide the President with a 
means to address the American public during times of national emergency.  They also provide authorized 
federal, state, and local alert originators an effective means to transmit local and/or statewide emergency 
alerts,7 such as severe weather alerts and America’s Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response (AMBER) 
Alerts.8  The Commission, in conjunction with FEMA, implements WEA and EAS at the federal level.
Wireless Emergency Alerts.  WEA is a tool for authorized federal, state, local, Tribal and 
7 The term “alert originator” refers to a federal, state, territorial, tribal, or local entity authorized by FEMA to use 
IPAWS to issue critical public alerts and warnings in emergency situations.  See FEMA, Alerting Authorities, 
https://www.fema.gov/emergency-managers/practitioners/integrated-public-alert-warning-system/public-safety-
officials/alerting-authorities/agencies-organizations (last updated Oct. 31, 2023).

3territorial government entities to geographically target alerts and warnings to the WEA-capable mobile 
devices of participating commercial mobile service providers’ subscribers.9  The Warning Alert and 
Response Network (WARN) Act10 establishes WEA as a voluntary system in which commercial mobile 
service (CMS) Providers may elect to participate and gives the Commission authority to adopt “relevant 
technical standards, protocols, procedures and other technical requirements necessary to enable 
commercial mobile service alerting capability for commercial mobile service providers that voluntarily 
elect to transmit emergency alerts.”11  While participation by wireless providers is voluntary, those 
commercial mobile service providers that choose to offer the service (Participating CMS Providers) must 
adhere to the technical and operational requirements established by the Commission.12  For example, the 
Commission’s rules require Participating CMS Providers to receive and transmit four classes of Alert 
Messages: National Alert (formerly known as a “Presidential Alert”); Imminent Threat Alert; Child 
Abduction Emergency/AMBER Alert; and Public Safety Message.13  The Commission’s rules also 
require that National Alerts must always be presented,14 by WEA-capable mobile devices, i.e., unlike the 
other three classes of alerts, which mobile devices can be opted out of receiving.15  
Since its launch in 2012, WEA has been used to issue more than 86,000 emergency alerts, 
including severe weather warnings, evacuate and shelter-in-place alerts, and AMBER alerts.16  More 
information about WEA can be found in the Appendix to this report.  
Emergency Alert System.  The Commission’s rules require EAS Participants to have the 
capability to receive and transmit a National Emergency Message (EAN), formerly known as a 
Presidential Alert, disseminated over the EAS.17  There are two methods by which EAS alerts may be 
distributed.  Under the traditional broadcast-based distribution structure, the EAS transmits an alert 
through a pre-established hierarchy of broadcast, cable, and satellite systems, starting with the initial 
delivery to 72 National Public Warning System (NPWS) stations, also known as Primary Entry Point 
(PEP) stations.  This first method is the EAS Protocol, a messaging protocol that delivers basic alert 
elements over the air.18  The EAS Protocol lacks the capability to deliver separate audio and non-English

term commercial mobile service as any mobile service (as defined in 47 U.S.C. 153) that is provided for profit and 
makes interconnected service available to the public or to such classes of eligible users as to be effectively available 
to a substantial portion of the public, as specified by regulation by the Commission.  See 47 U.S.C. § 332(d)(1).

4text files and is dependent on radio reception for the quality of the audio,19  but it serves as a reliable 
means of disseminating alerts to the public in situations in which IP-based services may not be 
available.20  The second method of distribution is over IPAWS, which is a FEMA-operated alert 
aggregator that authorized alert originators use to send WEA alert messages to Participating CMS 
Providers and EAS alerts to EAS Participants.  IPAWS alerts are formatted in the more sophisticated 
Common Alerting Protocol (CAP).  CAP-formatted alerts initiated through IPAWS can include audio, 
video or data files, images, non-English translations of alerts, and links providing detailed information.21  
The Appendix to this report contains additional information about the EAS, including a description of 
how the alerts are disseminated over the EAS.  
III. THE 2023 NATIONWIDE WEA TEST
The Parameters of the Nationwide WEA Test
This test marks the third nationwide WEA test, but only the second directed to all WEA-capable 
cellular devices.22  To reach all mobile devices the WEA portion of the test was sent as a National Alert,23 
which subscribers cannot opt out of receiving.24  The test message was sent to all consumer cellphones in 
the United States and its territories.25  The test 90-character message read: “THIS IS A TEST of the 
National Wireless Emergency Alert System.  No action is needed.”26  The 360-character message read: 
“THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. The purpose is to maintain and 
improve alert and warning capabilities at the federal, state, local, tribal and territorial levels and to 
19 The EAS Protocol uses a four-part message for an emergency activation of the EAS.  The four parts are: Preamble 
and EAS Header Codes; audio Attention Signal; message; and Preamble and EAS End Of Message (EOM) Codes.  
See 47 CFR § 11.31.  These parts can inform the public as to the nature, location, effective times, and originator of 
the alert.  See FCC, PSHSB, Report: September 28, 2016 Nationwide EAS Test at 3 (2016), 
https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-344518A1.pdf (discussing the value added from Internet-based 
alert distribution).

Order, 27 FCC Rcd 642, 655, para 27 (2012).
21 The Commission’s rules require EAS Participants to be able to receive alerts from both IPAWS and the broadcast-
based EAS structure.  See 47 CFR §§ 11.52(d), 11.56(a).  EAS Participants can deliver to the public the rich data 
contained in a CAP-formatted message received directly from the IPAWS Internet feed, but when the alert is 
rebroadcast over the daisy chain, the CAP data are lost, and EAS Participants receiving the alert over the air cannot 
transmit CAP-based features, such as digital audio or multiple languages, to the public.

message also was sent in Spanish, in both a 90-character version and a 360-character version.28  Per the 
Commission’s rules at the time of the test, Participating CMS Providers were required to transmit the alert 
message in both English and Spanish.29  The test alert message should be displayed in the device’s default 
language.  The Spanish-language versions of alerts should only be displayed to wireless subscribers 
whose device settings specify Spanish as the preferred language.30  
Key Observations from the Nationwide WEA Test
NYCEM Survey.  Following the nationwide EAS test, the New York City Emergency 
Management Department (NYCEM) administered a survey via the Notify NYC emergency 
communications program, social media, and partner engagement.31  NYCEM reported that of 1,405 
responses received, 94.2% of respondents reported receiving the WEA test message.32  The 5.8% of 
respondents who reported they did not receive the WEA test message provided a number of explanations, 
including: spotty service; on the subway/lacking cellular coverage; mobile phone turned off; phone in 
airplane mode; phone on “Do Not Disturb”; and using the phone for a voice call.  44% of respondents 
cited no known reason for not receiving the message. 33   For those respondents who did not receive a 
WEA message, 7.7% listed AT&T as their wireless provider, 18.5% listed T-Mobile, 33.8% listed 
Verizon, 15.4% listed “Other,” and 24.6% provided no response.34  NYCEM’s survey also revealed 
approximately 19.4% of respondents who received the WEA test did not receive the full WEA test with 
complete sounds/haptics, of which 49.2% did not have their devices set on vibrate and/or silent.35 
FCC Complaints.  The Commission received seventy-seven informal complaints from the public 
in response to the nationwide test.  The complaints included: (1) non-receipt of the test alert message; (2) 
the inability to opt out of receiving the test; (3) the loudness of the audio attention signal; and (4) missing 
tone and/or vibration.  The Commission also received several informal complaints that the test alert 
message was received in Spanish when the device user expected to receive it in English.

6PSHSB Letters to Wireless Providers.  On September 11, 2023, the Chief of the Public Safety and 
Homeland Security Bureau sent letters to the nine largest cellular providers that participate in WEA: 
AT&T; Best Buy Health; Cellcom; C Spire; DISH; Google Fi; T-Mobile; US Cellular; and Verizon.  The 
letters requested written responses regarding the performance of carriers’ networks during the test.  The 
letters to Best Buy Health; Cellcom; C Spire; DISH; Google Fi; and, US Cellular asked if the provider (1) 
received the test alert message and transmitted it to its subscribers; (2) experienced any complications or 
anomalies with its WEA capability; and (3) took any efforts to observe or evaluate WEA performance 
during the test.36  The letters to AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon asked those questions as well as several 
additional questions about WEA performance.37  The responses to the Bureau’s letters revealed the 
following information:  
•The providers reported receiving the test alert from FEMA IPAWS as early as 14:18:03 EDT and 
as late as 14:18:12 EDT.38
•The providers transmitted the test alert message as early as 14:18:04 EDT and as late as 14:18:19 
EDT.39
•Several providers experienced “anomalies” during the test:
oAT&T reported a fiber cut that affected nearly thirty (30) physical sites in the Dallas/Fort 
Worth and West Texas markets.  Service was restored approximately seven (7) minutes 
after the initiation of the test.  Once service was restored, the alert would have been 
transmitted to those subscribers that did not receive it.40
oBest Buy reported that eight subscribers did not receive the test alert message.41  One of 
its Jitterbug Flip 2 devices in San Diego, CA did not emit the audio attention signal and 
vibration cadence. 
oT-Mobile subscribers (and subscribers to Mobile Virtual Network Operators who take 
service from T-Mobile) reported receiving the WEA test alert message in Spanish even 
though they had not changed the device’s default language of English. 42  The issue was 
limited to Android devices running the Android R or newer Operating System, which 
have since been patched to address this issue.

7oUS Cellular reported that some of their test devices displayed “Presidential Alert” rather 
than “National Alert.”43
oVerizon reported that 1.663 seconds elapsed between receipt of the test alert message 
from FEMA IPAWS and Verizon’s transmission of the test alert message to subscribers 
due to the large number of cell sites in their network and the need for the two mated Cell 
Broadcast Entity facilities to coordinate the delivery of the English and Spanish versions 
of alert.44 
To the extent a nationwide WEA activation can be compared to the multiple local activations 
used during the 2022 WEA Performance exercise, the responses from AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon 
revealed that the issues seen in the 2022 WEA Performance Exercise did not recur during the 2023 
nationwide test.  For example, during the 2022 test, Verizon reported that two redundant Virtual Privatge 
Network paths between FEMA IPAWS and Verizon failed.45  Meanwhile AT&T reported that it observed 
five instances where FEMA IPAWS incorrectly sent the alert to AT&T’s inactive Cell Broadcast Center 
(CBC) in Allen, TX, rather than the correct CBC in Bothell, WA.46  Neither provider reported a similar 
occurrence during the 2023 Nationwide Test.47
IV. THE 2023 NATIONWIDE EAS TEST
The Parameters of the 2023 Nationwide EAS Test
This test marks the seventh nationwide EAS Test.48  For this test, the nationwide test alert was 
disseminated as a Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) message via FEMA’s IPAWS.49  The test message 
audio and text, which was designed to be identical to the greatest extent possible, was as follows: “This is 
a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, 
covering the United States from 14:20 to 14:50 hours ET. This is only a test. No action is required by the 
public.”50  Each EAS Participant received the alert either directly from IPAWS by polling the IPAWS

8Internet feed, or via a re-broadcast of the alert by the source that it monitors in the EAS “daisy chain.”51  
In this approach to relaying emergency alerts, a group of selected EAS Participants in each of the 72 
NPWS stations’ broadcast area, known as Local Primary (LP) stations, monitor these NPWS stations.  
When LP stations receive an alert they, in turn, broadcast the alert in their listening areas.  The remaining 
broadcasters, cable television facilities, and other EAS Participants receive the alerts from NPWS, LP, or 
other stations they are required to monitor and deliver the alerts to the public.  
Participation in the Nationwide EAS Test
At the time of the 2023 nationwide EAS test, there were approximately 25,306 EAS Participants 
in the United States and its territories.52  This estimate includes analog and digital radio broadcast stations 
(including AM, FM, and Low Power FM (LPFM) stations); analog and digital television broadcast 
stations (including Low Power TV (LPTV)); analog and digital cable systems; wireless cable systems; 
wireline video systems;53 DBS services; and SDARS.54
Table 1 summarizes the participation rate in the 2023 nationwide EAS test.55  Excluding 
duplicate filings,56 EAS Participants made 20,682 unique filings,57 with a participation rate of 81.7% up 
from 75.3%, in 2021.58  Radio broadcasters had a participation rate of 85.1%, up from 79.9% in 2021, 
51 Participants’ EAS equipment polls the IPAWS server to check for new alerts at regular intervals.  If an EAS 
Participant receives an over-the-air alert before it checks IPAWS, the over-the-air alert is retransmitted.  Beginning 
in December 2023, EAS Participants are required, upon receiving a legacy EAS alert message, to check whether a 
CAP version of an over-the-air alert is available by polling the IPAWS feed for CAP-formatted EAS messages.  If a 
CAP version is available, EAS Participants must transmit the CAP version rather than the legacy version.  Because 
this category applies to all EAS alerts except those with the EAN, NPT, or Required Weekly Test (RWT) event 
codes, this requirement is not applicable to nationwide tests.  See 47 CFR § 11.55(c)(2).
52 This total consists of the 17,363 radio broadcasters and 4,029 television broadcasters in the FCC’s Consolidated 
Database System, and the 3,914 headends active in the FCC’s Cable Operations and Licensing System.  This 
methodology likely overestimates the number of radio and television broadcasters that participate in the EAS, as 
some are exempted from the Commission’s rules that govern EAS.  For example, if a hub station satisfies the EAS 
requirements, an analog or digital broadcast satellite station that rebroadcasts 100% of the hub station’s 
programming would not be required to file in the EAS Test Reporting System (ETRS).  See 47 CFR § 11.11(b).

55 Throughout this report, data are calculated to the nearest tenth, which, in some instances, results in percentage 
totals just slightly under or over 100%.  
56 EAS Participants submitted 25,805 filings in 2023.  5,123 of these filings duplicated facilities for which EAS 
Participants had already filed.  The total number of filings include the cumulative tabulation for all forms received 
from a filer.  For example, if a test participant submitted Forms One, Two and Three through ETRS, this would be 
recorded as one filing, rather than three separate filings.
57 Unique filings are a set of filings that represent the report of a single EAS Participant facility, such as a radio 
station or a cable headend, with any duplicate filings removed.  Most duplicate filings were submitted for cable 
systems.  To the extent that EAS Participants’ filings indicate that a headend serves alerts using multiple, 
independent sets of EAS equipment, each set of equipment is considered as a unique headend for purposes of this 
report.  
58 See 2021 Nationwide EAS Test at 6.  For purposes of this report, participation rate is defined as the number of 
unique filings received from a specified EAS Participant type divided by the total number of EAS Participants of 
that type.  Federal Communications Commission

Table 2 provides an overview of the form types submitted in ETRS.  Form One asked EAS 
Participants to report basic identifying information, such as ownership or licensee contact information, 
EAS designation as identified in their State EAS Plan, and the make, model, and software version of their 
EAS equipment.  Form Two asked EAS Participants to report “day of test” results, including whether 
they had successfully received and retransmitted the test alert.  Form Three asked EAS Participants to 
report more detailed test results, such as the first source from which the alert was received, the language 
in which the alert was received, and details of any issues experienced during the test.  89.3% of test 
participants completed Forms One, Two, and Three, as required by the Commission’s rules, which is up  
from 87.8% in 2021.63  4.4% of test participants submitted “day of test” results in Form Two but failed to 
submit the detailed results required by Form Three, which is a smaller percentage than 2021’s 8.9% that

61 The Commission has determined that test result data submitted by EAS Participants be treated as presumptively 
confidential.  See Review of the Emergency Alert System, EB Docket No. 04-296, Sixth Report and Order, 30 FCC 
Rcd 6520, 6533, para. 27, note 90 (2015) (noting that test data received from EAS Participants or any reports that 
contain individual test data shall be treated as presumptively confidential).  Accordingly, Table 1 and others in this 
report reflect aggregated test result data so that no confidential information is revealed.  As referenced throughout 
this Report, PSHSB does not provide data for very small groups of EAS Participants and does not include them 
among the total number of filings.  The omission of this data does not change the assessment of the test in any 
significant way.  
62 Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) providers and cable resellers are not defined in Part 11 of the rules and are 
considered voluntary participants in the test in the EAS Test Reporting System (ETRS), the online system used by 
the Commission to collect and analyze the results of nationwide EAS tests.  See 47 CFR § 11.61(a)(3)(iv).

Table 3 compares the filing rate of Low Power broadcasters to that of all broadcasters and non-
LPFM/TV broadcasters.64  LPFM participation in the test (61.6%) was lower than that of non-LPFM 
broadcasters (87.5%) and radio broadcasters overall (84.6%), but higher than 2021’s participation rate 
(49.5%).  Similarly, LPTV participation (68.0%) was lower than that of non-LPTV broadcasters (78.6%) 
and television broadcasters overall (73.6%), but higher than 2021’s participation rate (47.4%).  As with 
the 2021 test, the low participation rate of Low Power broadcasters reduced the overall participation rate 
of broadcasters.  Of the 2,680 radio broadcasters that were expected to file but failed to do so, 759 
(28.3%) were LPFM Broadcasters.  Of the 1,063 television broadcasters that were expected to file but 
failed to do so, 604 (56.8%) were LPTV broadcasters.65

EAS Participant Monitoring of IPAWS
All EAS Participants are required to monitor IPAWS.66  ETRS Form One asked EAS Participants 
to confirm whether their facility’s equipment complied with this requirement.  Table 4 shows that 97.5% 
of test participants reported that they are complying with the IPAWS monitoring requirement—a slight 
increase from 97.4% in 2021.67  However, the raw number of participants monitoring IPAWS increased 
from 18,036 in 2021 to 18,747 in 2023.68

12Source of Alert
On ETRS Form Three, EAS Participants identified the first source from which they received the 
test alert.  Table 5 compares the sources from which the different types of test participants received the 
test alert.  A majority (63.6%) of test participants reported to have first received the alert from IPAWS 
and a minority (36.4%) first received the alert over-the-air.  Television Broadcast providers reportedly 
first received the alert via IPAWS more frequently than other participant types (70.6%).

Breakdown of Test Performance by EAS Participant Type
In ETRS Form Two, the Commission asked EAS Participants whether they had successfully 
received and retransmitted the test alert on October 4, 2023.  Table 6 shows test participants’ success 
rates for alert receipt and retransmission.  When compared to performance during the 2021 test, a majority 
of EAS Participant categories saw a noticeable improvement.  This is due in large part to the inclusion of 
CAP messaging in the 2023 test. The 2021 test only utilized over-the-air messaging to distribute the EAS 
message.  With the inclusion of CAP in the 2023 test, EAS Participants were also able to receive the 
message over the Internet.  
This data indicates that, overall, 96.6% of test participants successfully received the alert which is 
an increase from the 2021 success rate of 89.3%.  The overall retransmission success rate of 93.6% is an 
increase from 87.1% reported in 2021.  97.0% of radio broadcasters successfully received the alert an 
increase from 88.8% in 2021, and successful retransmissions improved to 94.7% when compared to the 
87.0% success rate in 2021.  Television broadcasters reported that 95.6% (up from 90.1% in 2021) 
successfully received the alert and 89.3% (up from 86.0% in 2021) successfully retransmitted it.  
Similarly, 95.0% (up from 90.8% in 2021) of cable systems successfully received the alert and 92.7% (up 
from 88.7% in 2021) successfully retransmitted it. Federal Communications Commission

Table 7 shows the performance of Low Power broadcasters in the 2023 nationwide EAS test.  
LPFM broadcasters had an alert receipt success rate of 90.1%, approximately 6.9 and 7.4 percentage 
points lower than the success rate of all radio broadcasters and non-LPFM broadcasters, respectively, and 
an alert retransmission success rate of 84.7%, approximately 10 and 10.6 percentage points lower than the 
success rate of all radio broadcasters and non-LPFM broadcasters, respectively.  91.5% of LPTV 
broadcasters successfully received the alert, which is approximately 4.1 and 7.1 percentage points less 
than the rate of all television broadcasters and non-LPTV broadcasters, respectively.  82.4% of LPTV 
broadcasters successfully retransmitted the alert, which is approximately 6.9 and 11.8 percentage points 
less than the rate of all television broadcasters and non-LPTV broadcasters, respectively.

14Equipment Performance
An analysis of equipment and software information within ETRS filings revealed that as of early 
October 2023, over 4,500 EAS Participants, approximately 23% of EAS equipment units, were either 
using outdated software (17%) or operating equipment that were no longer supported with regular 
software updates (6%).  The remaining 77% of EAS equipment units reported by EAS Participants were 
fully up-to-date.  
Fully up-to-date equipment had the highest performance results, whereas equipment using 
software that is no longer supported had the lowest performance results.  Of the EAS Participants that 
reported using EAS equipment units that PSHSB determined are no longer supported with software 
patches, 90% reported successfully receiving the alert and approximately 85% reported successfully 
retransmitted the alert.  Notably, approximately 5% of these EAS participants reported successful receipt 
of the alert but failed to retransmit the alert, likely indicating an equipment-related complications 
occurred.  Of the EAS Participants that reported using EAS equipment units that PSHSB determined are 
outdated but can receive software patches, 95% reported successfully received the alert and 
approximately 90% reported successfully retransmitted of the alert.  EAS Participants with fully up-to-
date EAS equipment units reported that approximately 97% successfully received the alert and 
approximately 95% successfully retransmitted the alert. 
Language of Alert
Form Three asked EAS Participants to report the languages in which they received and 
retransmitted the test alert.  Table 8 shows the language of the alerts that were received and retransmitted 
by test participants.  The test alert message was sent in both English and Spanish.  The table below 
reflects the number of test participants who elected to transmit the alert to their audience in Spanish.69  
More radio and television broadcasters reported receiving and retransmitting the test alert in either 
Spanish only or both Spanish and English than reported such receipt or retransmission in 2021.  The most 
marked increases were in radio broadcasters that received and retransmitted the test alert in English and 
Spanish, which were reported by three and eight radio broadcasters, respectively, in 2021, compared to 25 
and 33 radio broadcasters, respectively, in 2023.

V. ANALYSIS OF MOST SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
The Nationwide EAS Test: Complications
Test participants reported complications with the test that included equipment configuration 
issues, performance issues, audio quality issues, alerting source issues, and clock errors.  As in previous 
years, EAS Participants reported the complications they experienced in two ways.  First, ETRS Form 
Three provided a series of checkboxes that allowed EAS Participants to assign categories to the issues 
they experienced.  These categories were based on the complications observed in previous nationwide 
EAS tests, which included audio quality issues, equipment performance issues, software update issues, 
and user error.70  Second, Form Three allowed EAS Participants to offer more detailed descriptions of the 
complications through the use of explanatory text fields.

161. Complications Reported in Checkboxes
Of the 18,334 test participants, 17,187 reported through checkboxes that they experienced no 
complications during receipt (93.7%).  16,338 (89.1%) test filers reported they experienced no 
complications during retransmission.  In 2021, 12,275 (64.0%) reported by checkbox that they 
experienced no complications during receipt, and 13,328 (69.5%) test filers reported the same during 
retransmission.  Table 10 shows the categories of complications reported by test participants through 
checkboxes.  Of the 18,334 test participants, 1,147 reported through checkboxes that they experienced at 
least one issue during receipt 1,996 test participants reported that they experienced at least one issue 
during retransmission.  In all, participants reported 612 issues in receipt and 909 issues in retransmission 
through checkboxes.

3. Monitoring Source Issues
ETRS filings revealed that of 72 NPWS stations, two stations (approximately 3%) experienced 
technical issues receiving and retransmitting the alert on the test day, a decrease from seven of 76 NPWS 
stations in 2021 (approximately 9%).  ETRS filings also revealed that these stations failed to receive the 
CAP alert via IPAWS as a result of Internet issues.  One station specifically cited that their broadband 
Internet service provider was experiencing an outage, and the other cited that the Internet was “very 
slow.”  These stations did not successfully receive the nationwide alert from the over-the-air sources that 
they monitored.  
Table 12 shows EAS Participant performance by state and territory.  Five of the six poorest-
performing geographic regions were territories of the United States.  These territories were the Northern 
Mariana Islands (20% retransmission success), Guam (33.3% retransmission success), American Samoa 
(66.7% retransmission success), the U.S. Virgin Islands (88.9% retransmission success), and Puerto Rico 
(89.7% retransmission success).  The majority of explanations reported by these territories cited the 
following complications: equipment performance issues, transmission not received, equipment 
configuration issues, and Internet issues.  Notably, approximately 35% of the equipment used in these five 
US territories was outdated, which we believe could be a contributing factor to poor performance.  Rhode 
Island was the state with the highest number of alert receipt complications in the explanatory fields with 
33.3% of the filings indicating either audio or equipment issues.  States with the highest performance 
results for both alert receipt and retransmission were reported by Vermont (VT) and Delaware (DE) 
which both reported 100% successful receipt, and 98.9% and 100% successful retransmission, 
respectively. Federal Communications Commission

As a practical matter, one way for EAS Participants to reduce complications due to failure to 
receive the test alert, such as the complications discussed above, is to ensure that they monitor several 
independent sources of alerts.  Multiple monitored sources add redundancy to the system so that when 
one source fails, a test participant can still successfully receive the alert from elsewhere and retransmit it.  
We note that the Commission’s rules require EAS Participants to monitor two EAS sources for EAS 
messages that are formatted in accordance with the EAS Protocol, in addition to requiring monitoring of 
IPAWS.  We are aware that many EAS Participants already monitor multiple broadcast-based sources.  
However, we continue to emphasize the importance of multiple monitoring sources as required by our 
rules.  We also recommend that stations located far from NPWS stations consider the viability, 
technically and otherwise, of satellite sources of the broadcast alert.
4. Equipment Performance Issues
There were 348 test participants that reported equipment performance issues on receipt and 832 
on retransmission involving non-working equipment.  Participants cited that the equipment was out for 
repair, failed during the test, was missing, malfunctioned, was damaged/broken, outdated, or was in the 
process of being replaced.  Approximately 30% of the test participants that reported equipment 
performance issues on receipt, and approximately 20% of test participants that reported equipment 
performance issues on retransmission, were using EAS equipment units with either outdated software or 
operating equipment that no longer supports software updates.  Specific examples of equipment 
performance issues that were observed by outdated or no longer supported EAS equipment units included 
failure to connect to IPAWS, the ability to receive the alert but failure to retransmit the alert, and 
explanations that older equipment was not functional or compatible with other system components.  As Federal Communications Commission
21evidenced by these results, it is critically important that EAS Participants that are widely monitored use 
testing to ensure their EAS equipment is in reliable working order and outdated equipment and/or 
software is updated to the latest version or replaced to mitigate performance related complications and 
safeguard against security vulnerabilities. 
5. Accessibility Issues
Individuals with disabilities and organizations representing people with disabilities submitted 
observations to the FCC regarding issues relating to the accessibility of alerts. Informal feedback was also 
obtained from input directly emailed to the Commission.72  Filers noted that the manner in which the EAS 
test message was displayed in some cases was not accessible to people with disabilities.73  Specifically, 
filers reported that some EAS text crawls were overlapping with closed captions, too fast, not accessible 
due to a low contrast ratio between the text color and background color, too small, or unclear/blurry.  One 
informal complaint was received regarding a station’s selection of visually inaccessible font and 
background colors, and this complaint was resolved by the station to the satisfaction of the filer.  While 
these issues largely mirrored those identified in the 2021 Nationwide EAS Test Report,74 there were fewer 
complaints regarding specific television stations.
6. Text Crawl Issues
There were 38 participants on retransmission that cited experiencing text crawl issues during 
retransmission.  Test participants cited no onscreen crawl and audio only but no text crawl.  
7. Audio Issues 
There were 159 test participants on receipt and 204 on retransmission that explained their station 
experienced complications with receipt or retransmission of the alert due to audio issues.  Many test 
participants reported background noise, static, no tone/audio, low volume audio, only tones and no 
message, multiple audio tones, short audio duration, and/or unintelligible/distorted audio. 
8. Equipment Configuration 
There were 103 test participants on receipt and 94 on retransmission that provided explanations of 
EAS equipment configuration issues.  Participants in this category cited user-related configuration 
problems, including invalid firmware and improper connection to monitoring sources, incorrect tuning, 
and lack of software upgrades.  Most test participants that reported complications related to equipment 
configuration also reported that they had successfully identified and corrected the cause of those 
complications or were fixing it immediately
9. Clock Issues 
There were 84 test participants on receipt and 93 on retransmission who explained that an 
incorrect time setting within the EAS equipment caused complications with the ability to receive or 
72 See, e.g., Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies, Access Survey Report: IPAWS National Test 2023 (Dec. 
14, 2023), https://disasterstrategies.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Report-IPAWS-2023-Survey-Report-
accessible.pdf.  In this survey with over 400 respondents, the majority of respondents who received the WEA and 
EAS messages found them easy to understand.  The survey also provides anecdotal reports of barriers to 
accessibility by some respondents. 
73 See 47 CFR § 11.51.  
74 2021 Nationwide EAS Test Report at 19.Federal Communications Commission
22retransmit the EAS message.  Test participants noted that the time or time zone was set incorrectly, 
equipment clock was off, and/or the incorrect date was configured.  For example, if the EAS equipment’s 
time was not correctly synchronized to real time, it would not receive nor retransmit the EAS message, as 
the equipment would consider the message to have expired.
10. Internet Issues 
There were 65 test participants on receipt and 39 on retransmission that had internet outages 
during the test.  Participants in this category cited IP provider being down, Internet service down, Internet 
connection issues, and Internet firewall problems. 
11. Power Issues
There were 35 test participants on receipt and 28 on retransmission that explained they were 
having power outages or issues during the time of the test.  Most respondents citing power issues stated 
these outages were a result of local power outages at tower site, power supply failure/malfunction, or 
battery failure.
12. Signal Issues 
There were 30 test participants on receipt and two on retransmission that reported complications 
receiving or retransmitting the test message due to poor signal.  Test participants attributed the poor signal 
reception issues, or weak signal from their monitoring source.
13. XML Digital Signature Issues
There were 23 test participants on receipt and 17 on retransmission that cited their station 
experienced complications due to XML digital signature issues that caused complications with receiving 
or retransmission of the alert.  Most respondent cited that the IPAWS XML certification was 
invalid/expired or failed due to an invalid XML digital signature.
14. Lightning
There were 10 test participants on receipt and 12 on retransmission that explained their station 
was affected by lightening which hindered their ability to received and/or retransmit the test.  Lightning 
issues included damaging equipment necessary for broadcasting.  
15. Antenna Issues 
There were seven test participants on receipt and five on retransmission that reported they 
experienced complications with receipt and/or retransmission of the test signal because the antenna failed, 
was damaged, or was improperly positioned to receive the monitoring source.
16. Low Power
There were 11 test participants on retransmissions stated that they were a Low Power station and 
did not have a responsibility to retransmit.  Low power stations are required to broadcast the alert, though 
they are not required to have equipment capable of generating the EAS codes and Attention Signal.75  
75 See 47 CFR 11.51(a), (e) and 11.61(a)(3)(1).  Federal Communications Commission
23VI. NEXT STEPS
The Bureau will continue to take measures to improve the EAS.  To help address areas for 
improvement highlighted by the 2023 nationwide WEA and EAS tests, the Bureau will continue to 
address commonly reported operational complications and improve participation in the nationwide test. 
Specifically:
•PSHSB recommends that the Commission adopt rules to improve the operational readiness of 
EAS Participants.  The 2023 nationwide test revealed that 6.4% of EAS participants failed to 
retransmit the alert.  Additionally, 4.5% of EAS participants reported experiencing some kind of  
equipment related complication during retransmission of the alert.  It is essential that the entire 
public be able to successfully receive alerts in order to take protective action during emergencies.  
Failure to transmit an alert and deliver life-saving information to affected communities during a 
real emergency puts the public at risk.
•PSHSB recommends that Commission adopt rules to ensure that EAS Participants are updating 
their EAS equipment’s software and have a plan for replacing equipment that is no longer 
supported.  As of early October 2023, over 4,500 EAS Participants, approximately 23% of EAS 
equipment units, were either using outdated software or operating equipment that no longer 
supported regular software updates.  The 2023 test also revealed that fully up-to-date equipment 
had the highest receipt and retransmission performance results (97% and 95%, respectively), 
whereas equipment with equipment that is no longer supported had the lowest receipt and 
retransmission performance results (90% and 85%, respectively).  The use of equipment with 
older software or equipment that no longer receives manufacturer support increases the risk of 
alert failure as well as poses major security risks.
•PSHSB recommends that its staff engage with EAS Participants in the territories of the United 
States to improve EAS performance.  The 2023 nationwide test results showed that EAS 
Participants reporting from these territories, including the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, 
American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico were among the lowest performers for 
both alert receipt and retransmission.  These territories in particular have been plagued by 
multiple tropical storms and typhoons in recent years including Super Typhoon Mawar affecting 
Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in late May 2023,76 and Hurricane Fiona affecting Puerto 
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto in September 2022.77  PSHSB will work closely with 
EAS Participants and SECCs, and if necessary help reinvigorate SECCs and pursue enforcement 
actions, to ensure that EAS is effective in these territories. 
•PSHSB recommends that its staff work with FEMA to evaluate ways to improve the accessibility 
of EAS text crawl.  Filers reported that some EAS text crawls were not accessible due to 
circumstances such as overlapping with closed captions, scrolling too fast, having a low contrast 
ratio between the text color and background color, were too small, or were unclear/blurry.  It is 
important that EAS Participants take steps to identify and correct these issues before EAS is 
needed during an emergency.
•PSHSB recommends that Congress require all CMS Providers to support WEA.78  As discussed 
above, 44% of respondents who reported they did not receive the WEA test message did not 
know why the alert was not received.  Requiring all CMS Providers to support WEA would

24enhance public safety by ensuring greater consistency in the delivery of life-saving alerts to the 
public, making it a more reliable and effective warning tool for alerting authorities nationwide. 
•PSHSB recommends that the Commission adopt rules to improve the operational readiness and 
software updating practices of Participating CMS Providers.  Similar to the performance observed 
for EAS, 5.8% of respondents to NYCEM’s survey reported they did not receive the WEA test 
message and some providers reported that they experienced technical failures during the test that 
prevented members of the public from receiving the alert.  Just like in receiving EAS messages, it 
is essential that the entire public be able to successfully receive WEA alerts in order to take 
protective action during emergencies, and PSHSB finds that further action is necessary to ensure 
WEA’s availability and reliability.  
VII. CONCLUSION
The 2023 nationwide WEA and EAS test successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of WEA 
and the EAS as alerting tools, as well as the capability of IPAWS to disseminate these alerts to the public 
through the nation’s alert and warning infrastructure.  This year’s test also highlighted several areas in 
which WEA and the EAS can continue to improve and additional actions that should be taken to ensure 
that these systems are as effective as they can be.  The Bureau will continue to work with FEMA, EAS 
Participants, and other EAS stakeholders to improve the system and ensure that it remains effective and 
can transmit timely and accurate nationwide alerts to the public when they are needed the most.  Federal Communications Commission
25APPENDIX: HOW WEA AND EAS WORKS
Wireless Emergency Alerts
In 2008, pursuant to the Warning, Alert and Response Network (WARN) Act,79 the Commission adopted 
rules allowing CMS Providers to voluntarily deliver timely and accurate emergency alerts over 
subscribers’ mobile devices.80  The WARN Act required that the Commission undertake a series of 
actions, including the establishment and convening of an advisory committee to recommend technical 
requirements for WEA.81  Accordingly, the Commission formed the Commercial Mobile Service Alert 
Advisory Committee (CMSAAC).82  The CMSAAC submitted its report to the Commission on October 
12, 2007, as required by the WARN Act.83  The Commission subsequently promulgated rules governing 
WEA, within the timeframes established by the WARN Act.84  The WARN Act gives the Commission 
authority to adopt “relevant technical standards, protocols, procedures and other technical requirements 
based on the recommendations of such Advisory Committee necessary to enable commercial mobile 
service alerting capability for commercial mobile service providers that voluntarily elect to transmit 
emergency alerts.”85  The WARN Act also gives the Commission authority to adopt procedures whereby 
CMS Providers could specify their intent to the Commission to participate in WEA.86  76 CMS Providers 
79 On October 13, 2006, the President signed the Security and Accountability for Every Port (SAFE Port) Act into 
law.  Title VI of the SAFE Port Act, also known as the WARN Act, establishes a process for the creation of a 
national mobile alerting system, now known as WEA, whereby Participating CMS Providers transmit emergency 
alerts to their subscribers.  See Warning, Alert and Response Network (WARN) Act, Title VI of the Security and 
Accountability For Every Port Act of 2006, 120 Stat. 1884, codified at 47 U.S.C. § 1200, et seq. (2006) (WARN 
Act).

86 Id. at § 602(b), 47 U.S.C. § 1202(b).  Under the WARN Act, CMS Providers could elect to participate in whole, in 
part, or not at all.  Id. at § 602(b)(1)(B), 47 U.S.C. § 1202(b)(1)(B).  CMS Providers who intended to participate in 
WEA were required to specify their intent to the Commission in writing.  See id. at § 602(B)(2)(A), 47 U.S.C. § 
1202(B)(2)(A) (requiring that “within 30 days after the Commission issues its order under [Section 602(b)], each 
licensee providing commercial mobile service shall file an election with the Commission with respect to whether or 
not it intends to transmit emergency alerts”).Federal Communications Commission
26elect to participate in WEA, at least in part.87  Since its launch in 2012, the WEA system has been used 
more than 86,000 times to warn the public about dangerous weather, missing children, and other critical 
situations – all through alerts on compatible cell phones and other mobile devices.
The WEA system is a tool for authorized federal, state and local government entities to geographically 
target National Alerts, Imminent Threat Alerts, AMBER Alerts, and Public Safety Messages to the WEA-
capable mobile devices of Participating CMS Providers’ subscribers.88  As depicted in Figure 1 below, a 
WEA Alert Message is sent by an authorized federal, state or local government entity using the Common 
Alerting Protocol (CAP) to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-operated Alert 
Aggregator via a secure, Internet-based interface (the A-Interface) where it is authenticated, validated and 
subsequently delivered to FEMA’s Alert Gateway (the B-Interface).89  At the FEMA Alert Gateway, the 
Alert Message is prepared for delivery to the Participating CMS Provider by being converted to 
Commercial Mobile Alert for C-Interface (CMAC) format to render it readable by WEA-capable mobile 
devices.  The Alert Message is then disseminated across a secure Internet-based interface (the C-
Interface) to the Participating CMS Provider’s Alert Gateway (CMSP Gateway) for distribution to mobile 
customers over cell broadcast (CMSP Infrastructure).90
87 See FCC, Master WEA Registry, https://www.fcc.gov/files/weamasterregistry112019xls; PS Docket No. 08-146 
(containing a record of all Participating CMS Providers’ elections to participate in WEA).  
88 See, e.g., 47 CFR § 10.450 (geo-targeting); § 10.430 (character limit); § 10.400 (classification).
89 See infra Figure 1 (WEA Architecture).  CAP is an open, interoperable, XML-based standard that can include 
multimedia such as streaming audio or video.  See OASIS CAP v1.2 (IPAWS Profile for the OASIS Common 
Alerting Protocol IPAWS USA).  CAP messages contain standardized fields that facilitate interoperability between 
and among devices.  See id.
90 From a technical standpoint, the WEA system currently deployed by FEMA and Participating CMS Providers is 
based on standards created by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), the 
Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) (jointly, ATIS/TIA), and the 3rd Generation Partnership Project 
(3GPP).  See CSRIC IV WEA Messaging Report at 7.  We note that nothing in the WARN Act or the Commission’s 
rules requires WEA to be a cell-broadcast-based service.Federal Communications Commission
27Figure 1. WEA Architecture
Currently, Participating CMS Providers’ WEA infrastructure removes Alert Message metadata, including 
a description of the geographic target area for the Alert Message and the Alert Message’s expiration time, 
and then transmits the Alert Message content to their subscribers’ WEA-capable devices.  While the 
Commission’s WEA rules are technologically neutral, most Participating CMS Providers use cell 
broadcast technology to transmit WEA Alert Messages to their subscribers.91  When the Alert Message is 
received by a WEA-capable mobile device, it is prominently presented to the subscriber as long as the 
subscriber has not opted out of receiving Alert Messages of that type.92  
91 See CSRIC V, Working Group Two, Wireless Emergency Alerts – Recommendations to Improve Geo-targeting 
and Offer Many-to-One Capabilities, Final Report and Recommendations 8 (2016); but see Letter from Rebecca 
Murphy Thompson, EVP and General Counsel, Competitive Carriers Association, to Marlene Dortch, Secretary, 
FCC, PS Docket No. 15-91, at 2 (filed Oct. 10, 2017) (stating that some carriers offer WEA using a software 
application, rather than cell broadcast).  
92 See Joint ATIS/TIA CMAS Mobile Device Behavior Specification (ATIS-TIA-J-STD-100).  Subscribers’ right to 
opt out of WEA Alert Message receipt extends to all but the National Alert.  See 47 CFR § 10.280.  
Federal Communications Commission
28The Emergency Alert System
The EAS is designed primarily to provide the President with the capability to communicate via a live 
audio transmission to the public during a national emergency.93  The EAS is the successor to prior 
national warning systems Control of Electromagnetic Radiation (CONELRAD), established in 1951; and 
the Emergency Broadcasting System (EBS), established in 1963.94  The FCC, in conjunction with FEMA 
and the NWS, implements EAS at the federal level.95  The respective roles these agencies play are defined 
by a 1981 Memorandum of Understanding between FEMA, NWS and the FCC;96 a 1984 Executive 
Order;97 a 1995 Presidential Statement of EAS Requirements;98 and a 2006 Public Alert and Warning 
System Executive Order.99  As a general matter, the Commission and FEMA work closely with radio and 
television broadcasters, cable providers, and other EAS Participants and stakeholders – including state, 
local, territorial and tribal governments – to ensure the integrity and utility of the EAS.
FCC rules require EAS Participants to have the capability to receive and transmit National Emergency 
Message alerts (EANs) disseminated over the EAS, and generally govern all aspects of EAS 
participation.100  EAS Participants also voluntarily transmit thousands of alerts and warnings issued 
annually by the NWS and state, tribal, and local governments, these alerts typically address severe 
weather threats, child abductions, and other local emergencies.  As discussed in more detail below, non-
National Emergency Message EAS alerts do not require that EAS Participants open a live audio feed from 
the alerting source, but rather transmit alerts with prerecorded messages that can be delivered at the 
discretion of the EAS Participant, rendering non- National Emergency Message alerts (and their related 
testing procedures) inappropriate for end-to-end testing of a nationwide alert.101
93 See Review of the Emergency Alert System, Second Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 25 FCC Rcd 564, 
565, para. 2 (2010).
94 CONELRAD was not an alerting system per se but was rather a Cold War emergency system under which most 
radio and television transmission would be shut down in case of an enemy missile attack to prevent incoming 
missiles from homing in on broadcast transmissions.  The radio stations that were allowed to remain on the air, the 
CONELRAD stations, would remain on the air to provide emergency information.  See “Defense: Sign-off for 
CONELRAD,” Time Magazine, Friday, July 12, 1963.
95 FEMA acts as Executive Agent for the development, operation, and maintenance of the national-level EAS.  See 
Memorandum, Presidential Communications with the General Public During Periods of National Emergency, The 
White House (September 15, 1995) (1995 Presidential Statement).

29Broadcast-Based Distribution of EAS 
There are two methods by which EAS alerts may be distributed.  Under the broadcast-based distribution 
structure, illustrated in Figure 2 below, the EAS is designed to cascade the National Emergency Message  
through a pre-established hierarchy of broadcast, cable, and satellite systems.  FEMA initiates a 
nationwide, National Emergency Message alert using specific encoding equipment to send the EAN code 
initially to the Primary Entry Point (PEP) stations over a secure telephone (wireline) connection.102  PEP 
stations are privately owned commercial and non-commercial radio broadcast stations that cooperatively 
participate with FEMA to provide emergency alert and warning information to the public before, during, 
and after a national or local emergency.103  Upon receipt of the code, the PEPs open a live audio channel 
to FEMA and broadcast the National Emergency Message throughout their listening areas.  A group of 
selected EAS Participants in each PEP’s broadcast area, known as Local Primary (LP) stations, monitor 
these PEP stations.  When LP stations receive the National Emergency Message , they, in turn, open up an 
audio channel to FEMA via the PEP, and broadcast the National Emergency Message  in their listening 
areas.  The remaining broadcasters, cable television facilities and other EAS Participants located in each 
LP’s broadcast footprint receive the alerts from the LP stations, transmit the alerts to the public (or in the 
case of cable, to customers’ set top boxes), and open up the audio channel to FEMA through their PEP 
and LP.

the EAS and NOAA weather radio.  See National Weather Service, “NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards,” available

30Alerting via IPAWS
EAS and WEA alerts may be distributed over the Internet through the Integrated Public Alert and 
Warning System (IPAWS), illustrated in Figure 3 below.104  As of June 30, 2012, EAS Participants are 
required to be able to receive EAS alerts formatted in Common Alerting Protocol (CAP)105 from 
authorized emergency alert initiators over the Internet via IPAWS.  CAP-formatted alerts can include 
audio, video or data files, images, multilingual translations of alerts, and links providing more detailed 
information than what is contained in the initial alert (such as streaming audio or video).106  An EAS 
Participant that receives a CAP-formatted message can utilize the CAP-formatted content to generate 
messages in synchronous audio and visual formats, which then can be broadcast to local viewers and 
listeners.107  CAP also provides each alert with a unique alert identifier and supports alert authentication

CAP-formatted message beyond the EAS codes and audio message (if present), such as enhanced text or video files, 
can be utilized locally by the EAS Participant that receives it, but cannot be converted into the EAS Protocol and 
thus cannot be distributed via the broadcast-based distribution system, as reflected in the part 11 rules.  See e.g., 47 
CFR § 11.51(d), (g)(3), (h)(3), (j)(2).
