For questions about Tribal Consultation on the NPRM:
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed a new event code option to deliver critical messages to the public over television and radio about missing and endangered adult persons. Adding a new Missing and Endangered Persons or MEP event code to the nation's Emergency Alert System (EAS) would help law enforcement agencies issue timely alerts in accordance with the Ashanti Alert Act and drive increased public attention to missing persons cases.
Alert originators, such as local public safety officials, use the EAS by selecting from a group of event codes based on the nature of the situation (for example,  CAE  signifies a Child Abduction Emergency, otherwise known as an AMBER Alert).
In a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the FCC sought public comment on its proposal to create a new MEP alert code for missing and endangered persons who are over the age of 17 and fall outside the criteria for an AMBER Alert. The NPRM also asked about the relationship between this potential new category and the Wireless Emergency Alert (WEA) system.
The FCC's NPRM also sought comment on various questions related to this proposal. The deadline for initial comments was May 20, 2024, and reply comments were due by June 17, 2024.
The NPRM builds on a resolution passed by the National Congress of American Indians in November 2023, and work by the Department of Interior and the Department of Justice to collect comprehensive data on missing and endangered native and indigenous person cases in accordance with Savanna's Act. While a widespread concern, the issue of missing and endangered persons is particularly prevalent in Tribal communities, where American Indian and Alaska Native people are at a disproportionate risk of experiencing violence, murder, or vanishing.
Therefore, the FCC seeks to gather input from Tribal communities on the implementation of an MEP event code and has directed the Office of Native Affairs and Policy (ONAP) to host Tribal consultation on the NPRM. Tribal leaders and their representatives are encouraged to participate in the consultations and share their statements with the FCC. Please consult the �Upcoming Events� section on this page for registration information and send Tribal leader statements to Native@fcc.gov.
