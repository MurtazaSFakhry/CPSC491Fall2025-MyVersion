APPENDIX B – ELIGIBLE SERVICES LIST FOR EMERGENCY CONNECTIVITY FUND 
PROGRAM
I. INTRODUCTION 
1. In this Report and Order, we establish the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program 
(Program) to provide funding for schools and libraries for the purchase, during the coronavirus (COVID-
19) pandemic, of connected devices and broadband connections for use by students, school staff, and 
library patrons.  Before the pandemic, millions of students who lacked home broadband connections and 
access to computers were caught in the “Homework Gap.”  One study estimates that last spring, more 
than 15 million public school students did not have home access to either an Internet connection or a 
device adequate for distance learning, and approximately nine million of those students lived in 
households with neither an adequate connection nor an adequate device for distance learning.1  The 
pandemic has only exacerbated the inequities between students who have a broadband connection and 
those who do not.2  Today’s action addresses those inequities, helping to provide all students, school staff, 
and library patrons with the basic tools they need to engage in online learning and in so many other vital 
aspects of our increasingly digital lives.  
2. Today, even as there are hopeful signs that the pandemic is receding in this country, 
many schools and libraries continue to rely on remote learning and virtual library services as they adapt to 
changing circumstances.  Schools, with assistance from a wide array of federal, state, and local 
government resources, public interest groups, and Internet service providers, have worked to equip 
millions of students with tablet and laptop computers, Wi-Fi hotspots, and other forms of broadband 
connections.  Yet millions of students have remained unconnected to the Internet.3  At the same time, the 
closure of many libraries means that library patrons who were previously dependent on computer and 
Internet access at their local libraries lost their primary source of broadband access.  Just as schools have 
attempted to help meet their students’ and staffs’ connectivity needs, libraries across the country also have 
attempted to assist patrons in meeting their connectivity needs during the pandemic. 
3. To provide relief from the pandemic, on March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act 
of 2021 (the American Rescue Plan or Act) was signed into law.4  This Report and Order implements

more than just homework, and are missing all of school).

Divide, (2021), (Common Sense Media 2021 Report)

_what_it_will_take_to_permanently_close_the_k-12_digital_divide_vfeb3.pdf (estimating that as of December 
2020, between 9 and 12 million K-12 students still lack an adequate Internet connection in their homes and between 
4 and 6 million K-12 students lack access to an adequate device for distance learning).
4 American Rescue Plan Act, 2021, H.R. 1319, Pub. L. No. 117-2, 117th Cong., tit. VII, § 7402 (2021) (enacted), 
available at https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1319/text (American Rescue Plan Act) 
(enrolled bill).  The Act also designates that $1 million from the Emergency Connectivity Fund be available for use 
by the Inspector General of the Commission to conduct oversight of support provided through the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund.  Id. § 7402(c)(2)(B).  Support provided under the regulations adopted today is provided through 
(continued….)Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
3section 7402 of the Act, which established a $7.171 billion Emergency Connectivity Fund in the Treasury 
of the United States.5  Section 7402 directed the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) to 
promulgate rules providing for the distribution of funding from the Emergency Connectivity Fund to 
eligible schools and libraries for the purchase of eligible equipment and/or advanced telecommunications 
and information services for use by students, school staff, and library patrons at locations other than a 
school or library.6 
4. Pursuant to section 7402 of the American Rescue Plan, we now establish the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program.7  The support provided through this Program will first allow eligible schools 
and libraries to seek funding for upcoming purchases of eligible equipment, including Wi-Fi hotspots, 
modems, routers, and connected devices, as well as advanced telecommunications and information 
services, to meet the remote learning needs of students, school staff, and library patrons who would 
otherwise lack access to connected devices and broadband connections sufficient to engage in remote 
learning during the upcoming school year.  If additional funding remains available after the provision of 
support to eligible schools and libraries for future purchases of eligible equipment and services, we will 
provide schools and libraries an opportunity to apply for reimbursement of the reasonable costs they have 
already incurred in purchasing eligible equipment and services to meet the unmet needs of their students, 
school staff, and library patrons who otherwise lacked access to equipment or Internet access services 
sufficient to engage in remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
5. The Emergency Connectivity Fund Program is separate from the E-Rate Program, which 
has long provided funding for broadband services delivered to and within schools and libraries.  In the 
interest of efficiency and simplicity, however, the goals and measures, rules, and processes we adopt 
today for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program leverage our experience with the E-Rate Program.  
II. BACKGROUND
A. Emergency Connectivity Fund Program 
6. Pursuant to section 7402 of the American Rescue Plan, the Commission is required to 
promulgate rules no later than 60 days after the date of enactment that provide for the provision, from 
amounts made available from the Emergency Connectivity Fund, of support under paragraphs (1)(B) and 
(2) of section 254(h) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act), to an 
eligible school or library, for the purchase during the COVID-19 emergency period of eligible equipment 
or advanced telecommunications and information services (or both), for use by—
(1) in the case of a school, students and staff of the school at locations that include locations other 
than the school; and 
(2) in the case of a library, patrons of the library at locations that include locations other than the 
library.8
7. For purposes of the Emergency Connectivity Fund, section 7402 of the American Rescue 
Plan defines the COVID-19 emergency period as beginning on the date the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services determined that a public health emergency exists as a result of COVID-19 pursuant to 
(Continued from previous page)  
amounts made available from the Emergency Connectivity Fund and not from contributions under section 254(d) of 
the Communications Act of 1934.  Id. § 7402(c)(4).

4section 319 of the Public Health Service Act,9 and ending on the June 30 that first occurs after the date 
that is one year after the Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that a public health 
emergency no longer exists.10  In providing support through the Emergency Connectivity Fund, the 
American Rescue Plan directs the Commission to reimburse 100% of the costs associated with the 
purchase of eligible equipment and/or advanced telecommunications and information services, “except 
that any reimbursement of a school or library for the costs associated with any eligible equipment may not 
exceed an amount that the Commission determines, with respect to the request by the school or library, is 
reasonable.”11  Section 7402 of the American Rescue Plan defines eligible equipment to mean (1) Wi-Fi 
hotspots, (2) modems, (3) routers, (4) devices that combine a modem and router, and (5) connected 
devices.12  It also provides that the term “advanced telecommunications and information services” means 
advanced telecommunications and information services, as such term is used in section 254(h) of the 
Communications Act.13  Section 7402 of the American Rescue Plan further provides that the Commission 
is to adopt, and the Commission and the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), which is 
the permanent administrator of all of the Commission’s Universal Service Fund Programs, are to 
administer, the regulations adopted pursuant to section 7402.14  
8. The Public Notice sought comment on the provision of support from the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund consistent with section 7402 of the American Rescue Plan.15  A wide array of 
interested parties, including school districts; local, state, and Tribal governments; education and library 
organizations; public interest groups; E-Rate consultant groups; providers of telecommunications 
equipment and services; and trade associations filed more than 95 comments, 90 reply comments, and 70 
ex parte filings in response to the Public Notice.
B. E-Rate Program 
9. The E-Rate Program was authorized by Congress as part of the Telecommunications Act 
of 1996, and created by the Commission in 1997 to, among other things, enhance, to the extent 
technically feasible and economically reasonable, access to advanced telecommunications and 
information services for all public and nonprofit elementary and secondary school classrooms and 
libraries.16  The E-Rate Program allows eligible schools, libraries, and consortia (comprised of eligible 
schools and libraries) to request universal service support for what are called “category one” services 
(which provide connectivity to schools and libraries) and “category two” services (which provide

health emergency has been in existence since January 27, 2020 as a result of COVID-19 pursuant to section 319 of 
the Public Health Service Act.  47 U.S.C. § 247d.

15 Public Notice at 1-2.  Earlier this year, the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau) issued the Remote Learning 
Public Notice seeking comment on several petitions for emergency relief from parties asking the Commission to 
permit the use of E-Rate funding to support remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Wireline Competition 
Bureau Seeks Comment on Petitions for Emergency Relief to Allow the use of E-Rate Funds to Support Remote 
Learning During the COVID-19 Pandemic, WC Docket No. 21-31, Public Notice, 36 FCC Rcd 1304 (WCB 2021) 
(Remote Learning Public Notice).  The Public Notice makes reference to some of the comments and reply comments 
filed in response to the Remote Learning Public Notice, which have been incorporated in this docket, WC Docket 
No. 21-93.  We do not, however, address the issues raised in the Remote Learning Public Notice in this Order.

5connectivity within schools and libraries).17  Category one services generally include data transmission 
and Internet access services, while category two services include internal connections (e.g., Wi-Fi), 
managed internal broadband services (e.g., managed Wi-Fi), and basic maintenance of internal 
connections.18  
10. Eligible schools and libraries may receive discounts ranging from 20% to 90% of the pre-
discount price of eligible equipment and services, based on indicators of need.19  Schools and libraries in 
areas with higher percentages of students eligible for free or reduced price lunch through the National 
School Lunch Program (NSLP) or an alternative mechanism qualify for higher discounts for E-Rate 
eligible services and equipment than applicants with lower levels of eligibility for such programs.20   For 
example, the most disadvantaged schools, where at least 75% of students are eligible for free or reduced 
price school lunch, receive E-Rate support for 90% of the cost of their eligible category one purchases 
(that is referred to as a 90% discount).  Libraries receive funding at the discount level of the school 
district in which they are located.21  Schools and libraries located in rural areas also may receive an 
additional 5% to 10% discount compared to urban areas.22
11. To obtain E-Rate support, applicants must first conduct a competitive bidding process 
pursuant to the competitive bidding rules established by the Commission.23  They are also required to 
comply with all state and local procurement requirements.24  Applicants must also adhere to the E-Rate 
gift rule, which prohibits applicants from soliciting or accepting any gift or other thing of value from a 
service provider participating in or seeking to participate in the E-Rate Program.25  Similarly, service 
providers are prohibited from offering or providing any gift or other thing of value to those personnel of

19 47 CFR § 54.505(a)-(c).  For category one services, eligible schools and libraries may receive discounts ranging 
from 20% to 90%.  For category two services, eligible schools and libraries may receive discounts ranging from 
20% to 85%.  See 47 CFR § 54.505(c).

not directly or indirectly solicit or accept any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of value 
from a service provider participating in or seeking to participate in the schools and libraries universal service 
program.  No such service provider shall offer or provide any such gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or other 
thing of value except as otherwise provided herein.”); Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support Mechanism,

18801, para. 88 (2010) (Schools and Libraries Sixth Report and Order).  Consistent with the gift rules applicable to 
federal agencies, certain de minimis gifts, including modest refreshments and items that are worth $20 or less, are 
allowable under the rules.  47 CFR § 54.503(d).  For purposes of the E-Rate gift rule, the terms “school, library, or 
consortium” includes “all individuals who are on the governing board of such entities (such as members of a school 
committee), and all employees, officers, representatives, agents, consultants or independent contractors of such 
entities involved on behalf of such school, library, or consortium with the [E-Rate Program], including individuals 
who prepare, communicate or work with E-rate applications, or other forms related to the E-rate program, or who 
prepare bids, communicate or work with E-rate service providers, E-rate consultants, or with USAC, as well as any 
staff of such entities responsible for monitoring compliance with the E-rate program.”  47 CFR § 54.503(d)(2)(i).  
Similarly, the term “service provider” includes all individuals who are on the governing boards of such an entity 
(such as members of the board of directors), and all employees, officers, representatives, agents, or independent 
contractors of such entities.”  47 CFR § 54.503(d)(2)(ii). Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
6eligible entities involved in the E-Rate Program.26  Accordingly, under the E-Rate rules, applicants are not 
permitted to solicit or accept a gift or thing of value over $20 from a service provider, and service 
providers are not permitted to offer or provide applicants a gift or thing of value over $20.27  In light of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bureau provided a waiver of the E-Rate gift rule through June 30, 2021, the 
end of funding year 2020, to enable service providers to offer or provide, and E-Rate eligible schools and 
libraries to solicit or accept, broadband connections, devices, networking equipment, or other things of 
value that could help students, teachers, and patrons affected by school and library closures during the 
coronavirus pandemic.28
12. Subject to compliance with various E-Rate rules, applicants may seek and receive any 
amount of qualifying support for category one services.  However, each applicant has a maximum amount 
of category two support it can receive over the course of five years.29  Moreover, consistent with section 
254 of the Communications Act, E-Rate rules require schools and libraries to use E-Rate-supported 
services “primarily for educational purposes.”30  In the case of schools, the Commission has defined 
“educational purposes” as, “activities that are integral, immediate, and proximate to the education of 
students.” 31  In the case of libraries, it has defined “educational purposes” as activities that are “integral, 
immediate, and proximate to the provision of library services to library patrons.”32  Recognizing that the 
technology needs of E-Rate Program participants are complex and unique to each participant, the 
Commission established a presumption that activities that occur in a school or library or on a school 
26 47 CFR § 54.503(d); see also Schools and Libraries Sixth Report and Order, 25 FCC Rcd at 18801, para. 88 
(noting that “the restriction on gifts is always applicable, and is not in effect or triggered only during the time period 
when the competitive bidding process is taking place,” because “gift activities that undermine the competitive 
bidding process may occur outside the bidding period.”).
27 Schools and Libraries Sixth Report and Order, 25 FCC Rcd at 18801, para. 88.  In addition to de minimis gifts, 
the Commission’s rules allow for charitable donations, including literacy programs, scholarships, and capital 
improvements, as long as such contributions are not directly or indirectly related to procurement activities or 
decisions.  Id. at 18802, para. 90.  The Commission’s rules also permit certain gifts that are motivated solely by a 
personal relationship.  Id. at 18801, para. 88; see also 47 CFR § 54.503(d)(3)(i).

III. DISCUSSION
13. In adopting rules to govern the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, we recognize 
that Congress has directed us to act with haste, conducting a rulemaking within 60 days of the date of 
enactment of the American Rescue Plan.34  At the same time, we are mindful of the latitude Congress has 
granted us to determine what costs are reasonable to reimburse, as well as the purpose of the Fund to 
address the connectivity needs of students, school staff, and library patrons who would otherwise be 
unable to access educational and library services during the pandemic.35  Pursuant to that authority, and 
consistent with Congress’ intent, in this Report and Order, we move quickly to open an application 
process that allows eligible schools and libraries to first seek funding for purchases during the coming 
school year of eligible equipment and advanced telecommunications and information services to meet the 
needs of students, school staff, and library patrons who would otherwise lack access to basic educational 
opportunities and library services.  If the demand for these future purchases does not exceed available 
funds, we will open an additional application window to allow schools and libraries to seek funding for 
eligible equipment and broadband Internet access services that they purchased earlier in the pandemic to 
address the needs of students, school staff, and library patrons who would otherwise have lacked access to 
devices and services sufficient to meet their remote learning needs.  
14. Based on our experience with the E-Rate Program, we also draw on the existing E-Rate 
rules and processes to provide clear rules and establish quick and easy to understand processes for 
requesting and receiving support from the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, along with appropriate 
safeguards to protect the Program from waste, fraud, and abuse.  In this way, we seek to maximize the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program and focus limited funding to 
target the needs of those students, school staff, and library patrons who would otherwise lack access to 
connected devices and broadband connections sufficient to engage in remote learning and virtual library 
services during the COVID-19 emergency period.
A. Performance Goals and Measures 
15. The Emergency Connectivity Fund Program will provide funding for schools and 
libraries to meet the otherwise unmet connectivity needs of students, school staff, and library patrons 
during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Based on the record in this proceeding and our obligations under the 
American Rescue Plan, we establish three goals for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program:  (1) 
connecting and facilitating remote learning for students, school staff, and library patrons who would 
otherwise lack adequate access to connected devices and broadband Internet access connectivity during 
the pandemic; (2) ensuring that USAC efficiently and effectively administers the Emergency Connectivity 
Fund Program; and (3) providing pricing transparency for eligible equipment and services to inform 
future policy and purchasing decisions.  We also adopt associated performance measures and targets to 
determine whether the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program is successfully achieving these goals.36  
Setting clear goals for the Program, with performance measures and targets to determine success, will

34 See H.R. 1319, tit. VII, § 7402(a) (directing the Commission to promulgate rules for the Emergency Connectivity 
Fund not later than 60 days after the date of the enactment of the Act (i.e., by May 10, 2021)).
35 Id. § 7402(b).
36 Establishing these goals and metrics is also consistent with the Commission’s responsibilities under the 
Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, Pub. L. No. 103-62, 107 Stat. 285 (1993), codified as amended 
most recently by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-352, 124 Stat. 3866 (2011), at 5 U.S.C. § 
306 and 31 U.S.C. §§ 1115-16.Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
8help focus our efforts as we oversee use of the Emergency Connectivity Fund to connect and support 
students, school staff, and library patrons during the COVID-19 pandemic.
1. Connecting Students, School Staff, and Library Patrons During the 
Pandemic
16. We adopt as our first goal for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program helping to meet 
the need for connected devices and broadband Internet access services to facilitate remote learning during 
the COVID-19 pandemic for students, school staff, and library patrons.  The pandemic has caused 
students, school staff, and library patrons nationwide to shift from in-person instruction to remote 
learning.37  For some students and school staff (and many library patrons), this shift was relatively 
seamless, and education was able to continue remotely with minimal disruption.  For millions of others, 
however, those who lacked (many of whom continue to lack) necessary connected devices and broadband 
services, the transition to remote learning has been filled with barriers.38  Many school districts have spent 
scarce resources purchasing devices and Internet connections for students and staff to help bridge the 
gap.39  And, libraries have done the same for library patrons.40  Despite these best efforts, many schools 
and libraries nationwide lack adequate funding to ensure that all students, school staff, and library patrons 
are connected and able to fully participate in remote learning opportunities.41  
17. We will use two metrics to measure the success of the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program in addressing students’, school staffs’, and library patrons’ otherwise unmet need for connected 
devices and broadband connectivity:  (1) the number of connected devices funded with Emergency 
Connectivity Fund support that are provided to students, school staff, and library patrons who would 
otherwise lack access to a device sufficient to enable them to engage in remote learning; and (2) the 
number of broadband Internet access connections (including through use of Wi-Fi hotspots) funded with 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support that are provided to students, school staff, and library 
patrons who would otherwise lack access to Internet connectivity sufficient to engage in remote learning.  
To measure success in meeting this goal, we agree with commenters that recommend we collect 
information about the number of connected devices and broadband connections that are used to connect 
students, school staff, and library patrons through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program and release 
this data publicly.42  We direct USAC to release this data as part of its Open Data project for the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.
37 See EducationSuperHighway Comments at 1 (“During the pandemic, when student homes have become their 
classrooms, access to public education hinges on whether a student’s home has broadband access.”).
38 See Los Angeles Unified School District Comments at 1 (“Students living in poverty or who, for various reasons, 
lack adequate access to adequate broadband internet connectivity in their homes, are limited in their ability to 
participate in public education”).
39 See State E-rate Coordinators’ Alliance Comments at 2 (SECA Comments) (“During the last 13 months, schools 
have undertaken a near impossible task of determining which students and teachers did not have sufficient internet 
bandwidth at home and to try to make alternative arrangements for them, having to shoulder this entirely 
unanticipated and unbudgeted expense.”).
40 See, e.g., Urban Libraries Council Reply at 3-4 (discussing library efforts during the pandemic). 
41 See Education & Libraries Networks Coalition Comments at 5 (EdLiNC Comments) (“[A]s of December 2020, 
Common Sense Media estimates that between 9 and 12 million K-12 students still lack an adequate Internet 
connection in their homes and that between 4 and 6 million K-12 students lack access to an adequate e-learning 
device.”).  Information about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on broadband access for library patrons is more 
scarce.
42 See, e.g., EducationSuperHighway Comments at 9-10; State Educational Technology Directors Association 
Comments at 4-5 (SETDA Comments) (recommending that the Commission focus on the number of unconnected 
students and educators before receipt of Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support and compare the numbers 
after receipt of funding).  Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
918. We also appreciate the opportunity the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program presents 
to gather better, more accurate information about the number of students without connected devices and 
broadband services sufficient to engage in remote learning and the progress made towards closing that 
Homework Gap.43  At the same time, we recognize that during the pandemic school districts have been 
trying to meet the needs of their students and staff and therefore, they have not collected uniform data sets 
about their students’ connectivity requirements.  As part of the application process, we will, therefore, 
collect schools’ and school districts’ best estimates about the number of students in their school or school 
district who did not have access to adequate connected devices, broadband connections, or both when the 
pandemic began; the number of students who do not currently have access to adequate connected devices, 
broadband Internet access connections, or both; and how they expect those numbers to change with 
receipt of requested Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support.  Given the pressing demands on 
schools, we will not dictate specific data collection requirements, but instead will ask each school or 
school district to describe how and when they collected the information that they use for the estimates 
provided in their responses.  We direct USAC to release this data as part of its Open Data project for the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.
2. Efficiently and Effectively Administer Funding
19. We adopt as our second goal to ensure that the Commission and USAC efficiently and 
effectively commit funding and distribute support from the Emergency Connectivity Fund.44  The $7.17 
billion Emergency Connectivity Fund must be quickly made available to meet the immediate connectivity 
needs of students, school staff, and library patrons nationwide.  To make that happen, the Commission 
and USAC must make the application and reimbursement processes simple and efficient.  We will 
measure success towards this goal in two main ways:  (1) speed and ease of the application process and 
(2) speed and ease of the reimbursement process.
20.Speed and Ease of Application Process.  In the first instance, the application process 
should be easy for applicants to navigate and to use in requesting funding for eligible equipment and 
services.  We can measure success in terms of how quickly Emergency Connectivity Fund Program 
applications are reviewed, and funds are committed following the close of the filing window.45  
Consistent with the suggestions of some commenters, we set targets for how quickly USAC is able to 
review applications and release funding commitment decision letters after the filing window closes.46  
Some commenters have suggested that we adopt performance metrics that require USAC to complete its 
review of applications within 30 days of filing date, or within 30 days of receiving additional information 
from the applicant.47  While it is important that USAC act expeditiously, we also want to give USAC 
43 See, e.g., EducationSuperHighway Comments at 8; Common Sense Reply at 5.
44 See Schools, Health, & Libraries Broadband Coalition Comments at 8-9 (SHLB Comments) (suggesting that the 
Commission adopt high-level administrative goals for the Commission and USAC); see also Funds For Learning 
Comments at 3 (FFL Comments) (stating that the Commission consider the speed of funding commitments and 
reimbursements as performance measures for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program).
45 We will also examine how quickly the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program application filing window is 
opened.  See FFL Comments at 3 (stating that the Commission should focus on metrics such as the speed of funding 
commitments and reimbursements, and the utilization rate of committed funding, to monitor the efficacy of the 
Program).
46 See, e.g., SHLB Comments at 8 (recommending that the Commission set high-level administrative goals, such as 
setting a benchmark for USAC to approve applications within a set period of time); Los Angeles Unified School 
District Comments at 4 (recommending that the Commission set application and review timelines to ensure we are 
timely serving students). 
47 See, e.g., SECA Comments at 18 (recommending that the Commission adopt a 30-day time period for processing 
and committing Emergency Connectivity Fund Program applications based on the date or receipt, or from the date 
that the applicant provided the requested information to USAC); Alaska Department of Education and Early 
(continued….)Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
10sufficient time to do an appropriate review of each application.  We therefore set as our targets having 
USAC issue funding decision commitment letters for 50% of the workable applications within 60 days of 
the close of the first application window and 70% of the workable applications within 100 days of the 
close of the first application filing window.48  Based on our experience with USAC’s issuance of funding 
commitment decision letters in the E-Rate Program, we find that these targets will further the goal of 
quickly having applications reviewed and funding committed, while allowing us to also track USAC’s 
performance. 
21.Speed and Ease of Reimbursement Process.  Consistent with suggestions in the record, 
we will also measure the ease of the reimbursement process and USAC’s speed in providing an invoice 
submission process for Program participants and in reviewing invoices that have been submitted.49  We 
appreciate the suggestion of several commenters that we set a target for USAC of reviewing invoices 
within 30 days of submission,50 but in light of the very short time frame under which we are adopting 
rules for this new Program, we do not yet have enough information to set specific invoice review targets.  
Instead, we direct the Bureau in consultation with the Office of the Managing Director to work closely 
with USAC on the creation of an invoicing system for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program that 
allows Program participants to easily submit invoices and USAC to promptly review those invoices.51
3. Inform Future Purchasing and Policy Decisions Through Pricing 
Transparency for Eligible Equipment and Services
22. We adopt as our third goal informing future purchasing and policy decisions through 
pricing transparency for eligible equipment and services.  Our experience administering and collecting 
data on the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program will provide valuable information for future 
purchasing decisions for schools and libraries.52  We therefore agree with commenters that argue one 
(Continued from previous page)  
Development, et al. Comments at 3-4 (Alaska DEED Comments) (recommending a 30-day timeframe for 
application review).  
48 We use the term “workable” to mean that a funding request is filed timely and is complete, with all necessary 
information, to enable a reviewer to make the appropriate funding decision, and the applicant, provider, and any 
consultants are not subject to investigation, audit, or other similar reason for delay in a funding decision.  This is 
consistent with the way the term is currently used in the E-Rate Program.  See Modernizing the E-Rate Program, 
WC Docket No. 13-184, Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 29 FCC Rcd 8870, 8893, 
para. 59 (2014) (2014 First E-Rate Order).
49 See, e.g., SECA Comments at 18; Alaska DEED Comments at 4.  
50 See, e.g., SECA Comments at 18 (recommending that USAC be required to process and approve invoices within 
30 days of receipt); Alaska DEED Comments at 4 (recommending a 30-day review period for processing and 
approving invoices).
51 Because the Emergency Connectivity Fund is established in the U.S. Treasury, ultimate approval for payment of 
invoices rests with the responsible certifying officer.  31 U.S.C. § 3528.  Certifying officers are limited to federal 
employees and as such USAC may only review invoices and make payment recommendations.  Treasury Financial 
Manual, Volume I, Part 4A, Chapter 3000, Requirements for Scheduling Payments Disbursed by the Bureau of the 
Fiscal Service.
52 In 2014, the Commission instituted similar pricing transparency for the E-Rate Program.  See 2014 First E-Rate 
Order, 29 FCC Rcd at 8935-37, paras. 158-160.  As EducationSuperHighway and other commenters explain, the 
Commission’s decision in 2014 to make E-Rate data publicly available has helped drive down the prices paid by 
schools and libraries for broadband services.  EducationSuperHighway Comments at 9-10; Connected Nation Reply 
at 2-3; FFL Reply at 10.  Based on its analysis of that publicly available data, EducationSuperHighway estimates 
that, because of price transparency in the E-Rate Program and new technological improvements, the median cost of 
broadband for schools and school districts has decreased from $11.73 per Mbps in 2015 to $2.24 per Mbps in 2019.  
See EducationSuperHighway, “The State of Connectivity in America’s Schools,” 2019 State of the States Report 
(2019), https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/esh-sots-pdfs/2019%20State%20of%20the%20States.pdf.Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
11crucial aspect of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program is pricing transparency.53  We thus require 
USAC to make the pricing data from the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program publicly available 
through its Open Data platform.  The publication of this pricing data will allow applicants to review past 
prices paid by schools and libraries across the country for same and similar eligible equipment and 
services.  Doing so will put them in a better bargaining position when making such purchases in the 
future.  We direct USAC to make the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program application and pricing data 
publicly available within 160 days after the first Emergency Connectivity Fund Program application filing 
window closes.  
23. To measure progress towards this goal, USAC, subject to oversight by the Bureau and the 
Office of Economics and Analytics, should conduct or commission at least one survey of participating 
schools and libraries to determine whether the data transparency measures built into the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program are enabling program participants to make more cost-effective purchasing 
decisions in the future.  We will share the results of the survey with interested stakeholders and other 
policy makers, so that it can inform future policy decisions. 
B. Eligible Schools and Libraries 
24. Consistent with Congressional direction in section 7402, we adopt rules providing that all 
of the schools, libraries, and consortia of schools and libraries that are eligible for support under the E-
Rate Program are also eligible to request and receive support through the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program.54  In so doing, we also adopt for purposes of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, the 
same definitions of “elementary school,” “secondary school,” “library,” and “library consortium” as are 
used in the E-Rate rules, with one minor modification explained below.55  Those definitions are grounded 
in the definitions of “elementary school” and “secondary school” in section 254(h)(7) of the 
Communications Act, as well as the limitations on eligibility set forth in section 254(h)(4) of the 
Communications Act.56  We also specify that, as with the E-Rate Program, pursuant to section 254(h)(4) 
53 See, e.g., Consortium for School Networking Comments at 3 (CoSN Comments); EducationSuperHighway 
Comments at 9-10 (advocating that the Commission require USAC to release the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
data on its Open Data platform to allow schools to maximize the cost-effectiveness of their connected device and 
broadband connection purchases); Connected Nation Reply at 2-3 (stating that pricing transparency is an important 
element to ensure accountability). 
54 Section 7402(d)(7) of the American Rescue Plan defines an “eligible school or library” as “an elementary school, 
secondary school, or library (including a Tribal elementary school, Tribal secondary school, or Tribal library) 
eligible for support under paragraphs (1)(B) and (2) of section 254(h) of the Communications Act.”  H.R. 1319, tit. 
VII, § 7402(d)(7).  For simplicity, throughout this Order, we use the phrase “schools and libraries” to refer to 
“schools, libraries and consortia of schools and libraries.”
55 47 CFR §§ 54.500-54.501.  Under E-Rate Program rules, an elementary school is defined as “a non-profit 
institutional day or residential school that provides elementary education, as determined under state law.”  A 
secondary school is generally defined as “a non-profit institutional day or residential school that provides secondary 
education, as determined under state law,” and not offering education beyond grade 12.  A library includes “(1) a 
public library; (2) a public elementary school or secondary school library; (3) an academic library; (4) a research 
library;” and “(5) a private library, but only if the state in which such private library is located determines that the 
library should be considered a library for the purposes of this definition.”  Additionally, a library may also refer to a 
library consortium, which is defined as “any local, statewide, regional, or interstate cooperative association of 
libraries that provides for the systematic and effective coordination of the resources of schools, public, academic, 
and special libraries and information centers, for improving services to the clientele of such libraries.”  47 CFR § 
54.500.
56 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(4), (h)(7)(A) (defining “elementary and secondary schools” as the terms are used in section 
9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA)).  When home schooled students who lack 
access to eligible equipment or services are considered to be enrolled in public or non-profit private schools that 
provide elementary or secondary education, under the law of the applicable State, those schools can seek support 
from the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program for funding to provide such students with eligible equipment or 
(continued….)Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
12of the Communications Act, the following entities are not eligible to receive support from the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund:  (1) for-profit schools and libraries; (2) schools and libraries with endowments in 
excess of $50,000,000; (3) libraries whose budgets are not completely separate from any schools; and (4) 
library or library consortium that are not eligible for assistance from a state library administrative agency 
under the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA).57
25. The LSTA was recently amended to make clear that Tribal libraries are eligible for 
support from a state library administrative agency under LSTA.58  Consistent with the those amendments,  
and guidance from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, we clarify that Tribal libraries, which 
are by statute eligible for support from state library administrative agencies under the LSTA, are eligible 
for support from the Emergency Connectivity Fund.59  The current E-Rate eligibility rules were adopted 
long before the LSTA was amended and include a citation to an outdated version of that LSTA.  Because 
this proceeding is focused on the implementation of the Emergency Connectivity Fund, we do not amend 
the E-Rate rules at this time to reflect the change to the LSTA.60  
26. We decline to extend eligibility for support from the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program to other entities that are not eligible for E-Rate support.  We are sympathetic to suggestions from 
commenters that we expand the list of entities eligible to receive funding from the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund to include a wide variety of public and private institutions that have done excellent 
work helping students and members of the public gain access to broadband Internet access services and 
end-user devices during the pandemic.61  However, the Act specifies the entities eligible for Emergency 
(Continued from previous page)  
services.  See 20 U.S.C. §§ 7801 (19), (45) (codifying the definitions of “elementary school” and “secondary 
school” in the ESEA).

60 See, e.g., ALA Comments at 3 (stating the Commission must revise the E-Rate rules to reflect the 2018 amended 
language in the LSTA).  We recognize the Navajo Nation Telecommunications Regulatory Commission’s 
frustration with the current E-Rate rules regarding libraries as well as the statutory definition of elementary and 
secondary schools.  With respect to the latter, we do not have authority to take an approach that statutory direction 
does not allow.  See Navajo Nation Telecommunications Regulatory Commission Comments at 2 (NNTRC 
Comments).
61 See, e.g., Marie Bachman Comments at 3 (filed on behalf of Bethlehem Area School District) (Bethlehem Area 
School District Comments) (requesting that local housing authorities and local community centers be eligible); 
California Emerging Technology Fund Comments at 8-9 (CETF Comments) (seeking eligibility for entities with 
programs aimed at advancing digital inclusion); Grand Rapids Public Museum (suggesting museums be eligible); 
The City of Los Angeles et al. Comments at 2 (Local Governments Comments) (recommending that local 
governments and other entities that have stood up connectivity programs should be eligible); Norfolk State

provide educational opportunities to the general public); State of South Carolina Comments at 2-3 (South Carolina 
Comments) (recommending that when a school district or library system decides not to participate in the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program that independent afterschool programs be eligible and also that service providers be

13Connectivity Fund Program support and does not authorize the Commission to expand the definition of 
eligible entities.62  Thus, even when such institutions are acting in coordination with schools or libraries, 
there is no authority to permit such institutions to receive Emergency Connectivity Fund Program 
support.  Moreover, straying from the focus of the statute would divert much-needed funding from 
schools and libraries in dire need of assistance.  
27. We clarify that eligible schools and libraries do not need to be current E-Rate 
participants,63 but eligible entities, particularly those that have not applied for E-Rate support, should be 
prepared to demonstrate eligibility as a school or library under Program rules eligible for support from the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program during USAC’s application review.  
C. Eligible Equipment and Services 
28. We look to section 7402 of the American Rescue Plan to determine what equipment and 
services are eligible for support from the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  The American Rescue 
Plan requires that the Emergency Connectivity Fund be used for the purchase of eligible equipment 
and/or “advanced telecommunications and information services, or both.”64  Section 7402(d)(6) of the 
American Rescue Plan defines eligible equipment as (1) Wi-Fi hotspots, (2) modems, (3) routers, (4) 
devices that combine a modem and router, and (5) connected devices.65  Wi-Fi hotspot is defined as “a 
device that is capable of—(A) receiving advanced telecommunications and information services; and (B) 
sharing such services with another connected device through the use of Wi-Fi.”66  “Connected devices” 
are defined as laptop computers, tablet computers, or similar end-user devices that are capable of 
connecting to advanced telecommunications and information services.67  Section 7402(d)(1) defines 
“advanced telecommunications and information services” to mean advanced telecommunications and 
information services, as such term is used in section 254(h) of the Communications Act.68  
29.Eligible Equipment.  Consistent with the definitions in section 7402, we adopt rules 
specifying that the following types of equipment are eligible for support from the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program:  Wi-Fi hotspots, modems, routers, devices that combine a modem and 
router, and connected devices.  We agree with those commenters that point out that air-cards used to 
connect end-user devices to the Internet through cellular data services are wireless modems, and as such 
are eligible for support from the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.69  We find inapplicable to the

authorities, and community-based organizations).
62 See H.R. 1319, tit. VII, § 7402(d)(7).  
63 See NNRTC Comments at 4 (seeking clarity that eligibility is not based on whether a school or library is currently 
receiving E-Rate support).
64 H.R. 1319, tit. VII, § 7402(a)(1)-(2), (d)(1); see also 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(2)(A) (“The Commission shall establish 
competitively neutral rules—(A) to enhance, to the extent technically feasible and economically reasonable, access 
to advanced telecommunications and information services for all public and nonprofit elementary and secondary 
school classrooms, health care providers, and libraries”).

standard).”  Id. at § 7402(d)(10).

14Emergency Connectivity Fund Program the E-Rate Program’s requirement that applicants demonstrate 
that air cards (and wireless data plans) are more cost-effective than fixed wireless broadband services 
before seeking support for air cards (and wireless data plans).70  The Commission adopted that 
requirement for the E-Rate Program because schools and libraries require very substantial bandwidth 
connections to meet their on-campus connectivity needs, which in turn would require them to seek E-Rate 
support for large numbers of air cards to meet those needs.  By contrast, individual students, school staff, 
or library patrons do not need enterprise level bandwidth, and in some instances air cards may be one of 
the few options available to provide connectivity to them.  
30.Connected Devices.  Based on our review of the record, we define connected devices as 
laptop computers and tablet computers that are capable of connecting to advanced telecommunications 
and information services.  We expect connected devices to be Wi-Fi enabled and able to support video 
conferencing platforms and other software necessary to ensure full participation in remote learning.71  
However, recognizing that schools and libraries have had to make challenging purchasing decisions to 
equip students, school staff, and library patrons with devices during the pandemic, we decline to establish 
minimum screen size or system requirements for the connected devices supported by the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program and instead rely on schools and libraries to make the appropriate choices 
about their needs.72  At the same time, however, we expect connected devices to be accessible to and 
usable by individuals with disabilities.73  If people with disabilities require connected devices to connect 
70 See, e.g., CTIA – The Wireless Association Comments at 9 (CTIA Comments) (noting the differences in on-
campus and off-campus cost-effectiveness and urging the Commission not to import the cost-effectiveness 
demonstration requirement); see also Modernizing the E-Rate Program for Schools and Libraries, Order, 35 FCC 
Rcd 13793, 13795 n.17 (WCB 2020) (FY2021 Eligible Services List) (“Wireless data plans and air cards for mobile 
devices are only eligible when applicants have demonstrated that they are the most cost-effective option compared 
to a fixed wireless broadband connection.”) (citing Modernizing the E-Rate Program for Schools and Libraries,

E-Rate Order).
71 See, e.g., CETF Comments at 13 (supporting requirements that devices be Wi-Fi enabled with video and camera 
functions for remote learning); Local Governments Comments at 20 (stating that devices must be Wi-Fi enabled and 
have video and camera functionality); South Carolina Comments at 4 (recommending devices have an integrated 
web camera, be Wi-Fi enabled, and have a minimum of 4GB RAM processing for remote learning); 
Telecommunications for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, Inc. et al. Comments at 4 (TDI et al. Comments) 
(recommending that connected devices have “video, camera functions, Bluetooth, and hearing aid compatibility 
features” as well as apps to connect with relay services).
72 See Common Sense Comments at 7 (recommending the Commission allow schools to determine which device 
type is best for their curriculum needs); CETF Comments at 13 (recommending a device screen size minimum such 
as nine inches); Council of the Great City Schools Comments at 5-6 (CGCS Comments) (disagreeing that funding 
should be conditioned on particular standards when schools acted during an emergency to get devices to students);

required screen size); Virginia Department of Education Comments at 2 (VDOE) (strongly supporting flexibility in 
determining the system requirements of students’ and staff’s devices).
73 See 47 U.S.C. §§ 255, 617 (requiring equipment that provides telecommunications and advanced communications 
services to be accessible); see also CTIA Comments at 13 (while “mobile wireless devices generally are accessible 
to people with disabilities, . . . the Commission should encourage eligible schools and libraries to harness the 
existing accessibility features of mobile wireless services and equipment to efficiently and effectively utilize ECF to 
support students and educators with disabilities remote learning needs.”); TDI et al. Comments at 3 (encouraging 
that connected devices that use video conferencing be accessible, usable, and interconnected with relay services so 
that individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, deafblind, or deaf with mobility issues can utilize the platforms);

individuals with disabilities”).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
15to the Internet, we expect that schools and libraries will request such devices to accommodate disabilities 
if needed.74
31. By defining connected devices as “laptop computers, tablet computers, or similar end-
user devices that are capable of connecting to advanced telecommunications and information services,” 
Congress provided us the discretion to include connected devices beyond laptop and tablet computers as 
long as they are “similar.”75  Based on the record before us, we exclude desktop computers from our 
definition of “connected devices.”76  Although we recognize the functionality and value of desktop 
computers,77 we find that desktop computers are not similar to laptop computers and tablets because they 
lack the portability of laptop and tablet computers, which can be a drawback for many students, school 
staff, and library patrons seeking to engage in remote learning.  We also find it significant that instead of 
identifying desktop computers or any other stationary devices as eligible connected devices Congress 
identified a set of portable devices as eligible “connected devices” and gave us discretion to determine 
whether other devices are similar to those portable devices.  
32. Also, based on the record before us, we exclude mobile phones, including smartphones, 
from our definition of “connected device” because they lack the same functionality students, school staff, 
and library patrons need to perform necessary remote learning activities, homework, or research, and thus 
we do not consider them to be “similar” to laptop or tablet computers for the purposes intended by the 
statute here.78  Numerous commenters, including state education departments, education groups and 
public interest groups agree with excluding mobile phones from the definition of connected devices 
because such devices do not sufficiently allow students, school staff, and library patrons to meaningfully 
participate in remote learning activities.79  In establishing the Emergency Connectivity Fund, Congress 
intended to provide funding for devices that support remote learning.  The record demonstrates that while 
74 See, e.g., Educational Service Unit #9 Comments at 2 (ESU #9 Comments); Players Coalition Comments at 1

16a smartphone may be capable of connecting a student to his or her teacher or supplementing learning,80 it 
can limit the student’s ability to develop a class presentation or draft a research paper.81  At least one 
smartphone vendor shows that some of its smartphones are capable of being made more functional by 
being connected to larger display screens for video conferencing and to peripherals, like a keyboard and 
mouse.82  The fact that some smartphones can be made more functional for educational purposes by 
adding these extra peripherals does not persuade us that smartphones are similar end-user devices meeting 
the remote learning needs of students, school staff, or library patrons.  We also find it significant that we 
did not receive a single comment or other filing from a school or library claiming that they purchased 
smartphones to use instead of laptops or tablets for their students, school staff or library patrons or have 
found smartphones to be good substitutes for tablets or laptop computers.  
33. We also find unpersuasive the arguments of some commenters that smartphones should 
be eligible for Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support as eligible devices because they meet the 
definition of a Wi-Fi hotspot,83 because some schools were forced to purchase smartphones to act as Wi-
Fi hotspots due to supply chain issues at the start of the pandemic,84 or because the ability of smartphones 
to act as Wi-Fi hotspots was mentioned in the legislative history.85  Section 7402(b) of the American 
Rescue Plan tasks us with determining whether the costs of requests for equipment are reasonable, and 
even with a cap on the reasonable support amount for Wi-Fi hotspots,86 we do not find it reasonable to use 
limited Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support to reimburse schools and libraries for costly 
smartphones used as Wi-Fi hotspots, when much less expensive hotspots can serve the same purpose.87 
This is particularly true because smartphones have myriad other functions, such as cellular voice

17service,88 and we would have to choose between inappropriately expending resources on functions that 
are not core educational services that section 7402(a) of the American Rescue Plan was designed to fund, 
or allowing applicants to cost allocate eligible and ineligible portions of smartphones used as Wi-Fi 
hotspots.  However, importing cost allocation requirements into the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program is inconsistent with our goals of administrative simplicity and fast funding decisions.  It would 
create complexity for the applicants and for the USAC reviewers and would inevitably slow down the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund application processing.  As such, we agree with commenters that urge us 
not to require cost allocation decisions in the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program and decline to 
include smartphones in the list of eligible connected devices or Wi-Fi hotspots for the Program.89
34.Advanced Telecommunications and Information Services.  Although section 7402(d)(1) 
of the American Rescue Plan defines “advanced telecommunications and information services” by 
reference to section 254(h) of the Communications Act, the Communications Act does not offer a 
definition of that term.  Instead, in the context of determining what services should receive E-Rate 
support, the Commission has recognized that section 254 grants “the Commission broad and flexible 
authority to set the list of [E-Rate supported] services” and “to design the specific mechanisms of 
support.”90  As the Commission has recognized, “[t]his authority reflects Congress’s recognition that 
technology needs are constantly “evolving” in light of “advances in telecommunications and information 
technologies and services.”91  As the Commission has done in the E-Rate context, we find that because 
the amount of available funding is finite, “we must make thoughtful decisions about what services are not 
just permissible to support, but are the most essential to support.”92
35. The Public Notice sought comment on treating a subset of the services currently eligible 
for category one E-Rate support as eligible “advanced telecommunications and information services” for 
the purposes of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.93  Based on the statutory text enumerating the 
equipment eligible for the Emergency Connectivity Fund (i.e., Wi-Fi hotspots, modems, routers, devices 
that combine a modem and a router, and connected devices), as well as the statutory language allowing 
Emergency Connectivity Fund support for the “purchase” of advanced telecommunications and 
information services,”94 we understand the legislation to be focused on quickly reaching students learning 
at home primarily through commercially available Internet access services delivered via Wi-Fi hotspots 
with wireless broadband connectivity or via leased modems with fixed broadband connectivity, generally 
delivered from a local Internet service provider.95  We therefore find, that, unless there is no Internet 
access service available to purchase in an area, to qualify for funding as advanced telecommunications or 
information services, schools and libraries will only be reimbursed for purchasing a commercially

students, school staff, or library patrons.96  
36.Dark Fiber and New Networks.  With the one exception for areas where no service is 
available for purchase, we exclude from eligibility funding for dark fiber97 and the construction of new 
networks, including the construction of self-provisioned networks.98  In so doing, we agree with 
commenters that argue that, as a general rule, using Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support to 
construct new networks or self-provisioned networks is inconsistent with Congress’ intent to fund “the 
purchase” of broadband services to meet students, school staff and library patrons’ immediate needs, 
rather than the construction of networks.99  As such, we disagree with those commenters that argue that 
Congress intended that the Emergency Connectivity Fund be used to support everything eligible under the 
E-Rate Program’s category one services because it referenced “advanced telecommunications and 
information services” under section 254(h) of the Communications Act.100  The E-Rate Program does not 
provide funding for all types of advanced telecommunications and information services.101  Instead, over 
time, the Commission has evaluated whether and under what conditions providing funding for various 
types of advanced telecommunications and information services would be both cost-effective and further 
the policy goals of the program.102  For example, when the Commission chose to make school and library 
self-provisioned networks eligible in 2014, it did so subject to strict competitive bid requirements and 
cost-effectiveness safeguards to ensure that E-Rate funds are only spent on a self-provisioned network 
when it is demonstrated to be the most cost-effective option.103 
96 See, e.g., NTCA Comments at 3.  For clarity, if a commercially available service requires equipment at the 
customer premises to connect to the router or modem, including a satellite dish or fixed wireless receiver, it is 
eligible.  
97 Dark-fiber leases and other dark-fiber service agreements are commercial arrangements in which a broadband 
customer purchases use of a portion of a provider-owned and maintained fiber network separately from the service 
of lighting (i.e., transmitting information over) that fiber.  See 2014 Second E-Rate Order, 29 FCC Rcd at 15550, 
para. 31.

devices that can be used to construct or provision new networks, which are inherently longer-term projects);

networks is contrary to the goal of getting service to those in need as soon as possible).

1937. Here, where we are primarily relying on local, state, and Tribal procurement 
requirements and striving to provide a simple application review process, where it is possible to purchase 
broadband Internet access services, we think that is the most prudent path for meeting the goals of the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program of quickly getting connectivity to students, school staff, and 
library patrons.104  Moreover, in our experience with the E-Rate Program and as supported by the 
record,105 planning and executing self-provisioned networks is complex and time-consuming.  Although 
there are narrow instances where constructing a new network is speedy and reasonable, and therefore we 
provide one limited exception, we are not persuaded that on the whole, network construction is consistent 
with or appropriate given the goals of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program to quickly fund schools 
and libraries during the pandemic or consistent with the statute and section 254(h)(2)(A)’s direction that 
the Commission create rules to enhance economically reasonable access to support advanced 
telecommunications and information services.106  This is a short-term program, designed to give students, 
school staff, and library patrons access to devices and connectivity that is needed now for remote learning 
during the COVID-19 emergency period.  Therefore, we believe Congress intended us to provide funding 
for a narrower set of commercially available Internet access services, and doing so provides a path to 
offering fast and simple application and reimbursement processes for desperately needed equipment and 
services.  
38. We recognize that some schools and libraries have taken extraordinary steps to connect 
their students and patrons since the start of the pandemic and applaud their commitment to connect their 
104 While stakeholders argue that such network expansion or construction could be a more cost-effective way 
(particularly over a longer period of time) to spend limited Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support to 
connect students, school staff, and library patrons, they largely do not provide clear and detailed evidence of such 
cost savings.  See, e.g., Public Interest Organizations Comments at 27-28 (PIOs Comments); PIOs Reply at 14-16 
(arguing that self-provisioned networks are not inherently more expensive); SHLB Comments at 16-22; Letter from

State Educational Technology Directors Association, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 21-93, 
at 2 (filed May 6, 2021) (COSN/SETDA Ex Parte) (urging the Commission to defer to local decisionmakers to 
allow for network construction when it is the most cost-effective approach).  Instead, commenters suggest detailed 
USAC project reviews, prospective cost-effectiveness rules similar to those used in the E-Rate Program, or the 
imposition of a per-student cap on total network project costs.  See, e.g., ADTRAN, Inc. Comments at 10 
(ADTRAN Comments) (suggesting adopting “the same rigorous safeguards” the Commission uses for self-
provisioned E-Rate networks); EducationSuperHighway Comments at 11 (stating the Commission should use the 
same approach it uses to evaluate special construction programs in the E-Rate Program, specifically requiring a 
showing that the project deliver 25 Mbps/3 Mbps at an equal or lesser total cost over a five-year period to a

20students, school staff, and library patrons.107  But, by excluding support for potentially costly construction 
or self-provisioning projects, we are able to satisfy the Congressional goals and swiftly act to provide 
much-needed support to more schools and libraries throughout the country.  We thus find that providing 
support for such network construction in areas with commercially available options would be inconsistent 
with the emergency purposes of the Emergency Connectivity Fund and better addressed through other 
Commission Universal Service Fund Programs or broadband efforts that have established competitive 
bidding and cost-effectiveness safeguards.108  Adding all such program safeguards for areas with 
commercially available connectivity would be administratively burdensome and contrary to the goal to 
quickly provide access to equipment and connectivity to students, school staff, and library patrons during 
the pandemic.109
39. Some stakeholders agree that excluding dark fiber and other network construction makes 
sense due to the nature of the emergency,110 but many seek flexibility and inclusion of additional 
equipment that may be used, to extend a school or library’s existing E-Rate-supported broadband service 
to students’ homes (largely, wirelessly) or provision a separate network.111  We disagree that the language 
in section 7402 of the American Rescue Plan should be read to allow funding for additional, 
unenumerated equipment for network expansion112 and to use Emergency Connectivity Fund support for 
antennas,113 cell towers,114 Citizens Band Radio Service (CBRS), television white space (TVWS) base 
stations,115 or drone-powered Internet,116 and other such wireless network equipment, except in the case

21outlined below.  To the extent schools and libraries expanded their networks or built new networks to 
serve their students or library patrons over the last year,117 such equipment is ineligible for reimbursement 
through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, except for the portions of the network that fit into 
the enumerated list of eligible equipment (i.e., Wi-Fi hotspots, modems, routers, or devices that combine 
a modem and router).  Relatedly, we are focusing today on implementation of section 7402 of the 
American Rescue Plan, and therefore, this Order does not address requests for action on a petition to 
allow schools and libraries to use their E-Rate-supported networks without cost-allocating out the off-
campus use during the pandemic.118  
40.Limited exception for network construction and/or datacasting where there is no 
commercially available Internet access service option.  Despite this understanding of Congress’ intent to 
speed funding to schools and libraries through commercially available broadband Internet access service 
offerings, we provide a limited exception to this finding.  The record reflects the fact that in some 
instances there is simply no commercially available Internet access service for purchase available to reach 
students, school staff, and library patrons in their homes.119  In only those limited instances,120 network 
construction (including construction of wireless networks) is the only way to quickly bring Internet 
connectivity to these students, school staff, and library patrons, and we believe that the “purchase” of 
equipment necessary to make advanced telecommunications and information services functional is 
consistent with Congress’ intent to provide emergency connectivity to students, school staff, and library 
patrons that do not have any other Internet access options.  The record also demonstrates that where 
commercially available Internet access services are not available datacasting can help meet students’ 
remote learning needs by providing them with access to educational content outside of school.121  
Therefore, where there are no such commercially available broadband Internet access services available, 
we will allow schools and libraries to seek Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support to construct or 
self-provision networks to connect students, school staff, and library patrons during the COVID-19 
emergency period who would otherwise not be connected to the Internet, and we will not require schools

focusing on areas with no available services.

22and libraries to engage in competitive bidding.  Under those same circumstances we will also allow 
schools and libraries to seek support for the customer premises equipment needed to receive access to 
educational content through datacasting.122  Some schools are already using datacasting and others may 
have already constructed wireless networks where there were no commercially available options and 
cannot go back and conduct competitive bidding.  We also considered requiring competitive bidding for 
applicants in areas with no commercially available options,123 but the timing does not work in light of the 
COVID-19 emergency and upcoming school year.  
41. To reduce the risk of using emergency funding on time-consuming infrastructure 
construction projects better suited for funding from other programs, applicants seeking support for 
network construction, including self-provisioned networks, and those seeking support for customer 
premises equipment used to receive datacasting services, must therefore demonstrate that there were no 
commercially available Internet access service options sufficient to support remote learning from one or a 
combination of providers.124  For networks already constructed or equipment already purchased during the 
pandemic, applicants must show that services were provided to students, school staff, or library patrons 
during the funding period supported by the second filing window.  For future construction, they must 
show that construction is completed and services provided within one year of a funding commitment 
decision.125  Applicants seeking support for network construction or customer premises equipment used to 
receive datacasting services must define the geographic area that was or will be served and assess the 
estimated number of students and school staff, or library patrons to be served.126  Schools and libraries

Parte at 2 (seeking clarification that standard does not apply to the entire geographic footprint); Letter from Gina 
Spade, Counsel for ENA Services, LLC, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 21-93, at 1-2 (filed

FCC, WC Docket No. 21-93, at 2 (filed May 5, 2021) (questioning whether every student, school staff, or library 
patron must lack access).  We agree that applicants do not have to demonstrate that there are no students or library

library patrons that have no commercially available services available to them in order to make this demonstration. Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
23must be able to provide clear evidence127 demonstrating how they determined that an existing fixed or 
mobile broadband network sufficient to support remote learning was or is not available and that for 
prospective network construction, that they sought service from existing providers serving the area prior 
to constructing a new network, and that such providers were unable or unwilling to provide services 
sufficient to meet the remote learning needs of their students, school staff, or library patrons.128  
Additionally, when the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support is sought for future construction, 
or for customer premises equipment used to receive datacasting services, applicants will be required to 
certify that they sought service from existing service providers in the relevant area and that such providers 
were unable or unwilling to provide broadband Internet access services sufficient to meet the remote 
learning needs of their students, school staff or library patrons.129 
42.Minimum Service Standards.  While the benefits to students, school staff, and library 
patrons of receiving high speed broadband services that include no data caps and low latency are well 
documented in the record,130 because of the current emergency and the lack of ubiquitous high speed 
broadband nationwide, we decline to apply minimum service standards to covered services for the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  As commenters recognize, to do otherwise would penalize 
schools, libraries, students, school staff, and library patrons in places where slower speed, data capped,

Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 21-93, at 2 (filed May 6, 2021) (providing examples of data applicants could use to 
demonstrate that there are no commercially available services available); Letter from Michael Romano, Senior Vice 
President – Industry Affairs and Business Development, NTCA-The Rural Broadband Association, to Marlene H. 
Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 21-93, at 2 (filed May 6, 2021) (suggesting further examples).
128 See, e.g., USTelecom Ex Parte at 2 (suggesting applicants have clear evidence of their determination that they 
meet the requirements of the exception); CoSN/SETDA Ex Parte at 2 (urging clarification that the exception 
accounts for instances where the signal is too weak to support remote learning); Letter from Michael Calabrese, 
Director, Wireless Future Project, New America’s Open Technology Institute, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, 
FCC, WC Docket No. 21-93, at 2, 4 (filed May 6, 2021) (seeking clarification that commercially available services 
be sufficient to enable remote learning); Letter from Thomas Cohen, Counsel to ACA Connects – America’s 
Communications Association, to Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 21-93, at 1-2, n.3 (filed May 
5, 2021) (seeking clarification of how applicants demonstrate compliance). 
129 We make the affirmative showing of requests applicable only to prospective requests for service because 
applicants that already constructed such networks may be able to demonstrate there was no commercially available 
service available, but not specifically document requests to service providers.  See, e.g., SHLB May 6 Ex Parte  at 1, 
3-4 (noting that “very few service providers will ‘refuse’ to provide service, but those services then do not provide 
sufficient coverage” and providing an example of a rural school district in Oregon that purchased hotspots, but could 
not use any of them because of poor reception).
130 See, e.g., ALA Comments at 6 (recommending 50 Mbps download and 10 Mbps upload as a target, rather than a 
limit, to address the needs of patrons and students with multiple household members and interactive video sessions); 
ADTRAN Comments at 4 (suggesting a mandated 25 Mbps/3 Mbps, 1024 GB data usage monthly, and a limit on 
high latency service (over 100 ms) to support interactive real-time applications); CETF Comments at 12 (supporting 
minimum service standards for bandwidth and data usage and concluding that 25 Mbps/3 Mbps is inadequate for 
remote learning); Common Sense Comments at 7-8 (stating that 25 Mbps/3 Mbps may constrain the ability of 
students to participate in synchronous learning, but cautioning against prescriptive requirements); CoSN Comments 
at 9 (recommending that 25 Mbps/12 Mbps be established as a per-student guideline based on their study of remote 
learning needs, but not as a requirement that could burden the most difficult to connect areas); Local Governments 
Comments at 12-19 (providing an explanation of the various bandwidth needs for a family and highlighting the need 
for at least 7 Mbps of upload speed for video conferencing applications); TDI et al. Comments at 5 (recommending 
at least 50 Mbps download and upload to accommodate the necessary use of telecommunications relay services for 
individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, deafblind, and deaf with mobility disabilities; and highlighting that 
additional bandwidth is necessary to access e-learning with the disability accommodations of captioners, 
interpreters, and other services).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
24and/or high latency services are currently the only affordable options.131  We also recognize that schools 
and libraries made purchases over the last year based on availability during the emergency, but without 
specific knowledge of whether such purchases might be eligible or ineligible for future support, such as 
from the Emergency Connectivity Fund.132  Moreover, as commenters argue, schools and libraries are in 
the best position to know what is available and sufficient for their remote learning needs.133  We expect 
that schools and libraries will make the best decisions to meet the remote learning needs of their students, 
school staff, or library patrons.  We therefore find that to qualify for funding as advanced 
telecommunications or information services purchased by schools and libraries for off-campus use by 
students, school staff, or library patrons, a service must include a fixed or mobile broadband connection 
that permits students, school staff, or library patrons to use those connections for remote learning or 
library services.  The approach we take today maximizes available choices during this emergency and 
thus speeds Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support to eligible schools and libraries making good 
faith efforts to facilitate remote learning throughout the pandemic.
43.Installation, Taxes, and Fees.  We agree with commenters that the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program should also cover reasonable costs of the enumerated equipment, connected 
devices, and services, including installation, activation, and initial configuration costs, taxes, and fees.134  
Such action is consistent with the E-Rate Program135 and most logically aligns with Congress’ desire to 
cover the reimbursement of eligible equipment and services needed for remote learning without requiring 
a complicated cost allocation of items on participant invoices.136  
44.Other Requests for Eligible Services and Equipment.  Commenters suggest many other 
types of equipment, services, or software be eligible for Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support 
including cybersecurity tools, learning management systems, private network services, online learning 
services that support online learning platforms, video conferencing equipment, and standalone 
131 See, e.g., Alaska DEED Comments at 3 (stating that minimum service standards will act as a barrier to eligibility 
altogether); Kenneth H. Stone Comments at 2 (filed on behalf of Buffalo & Erie County Public Library) (Buffalo & 
Erie County Public Library Comments) (noting that 25 Mbps/3 Mbps is not achievable for hotspots in some areas); 
GCI Communication Corp. Comments at 5-8 (noting that a standard cuts off those in need, like the many students in 
Alaska that do not have 25 Mbps/3 Mbps available to them).

extraordinary efforts to support remote learning).

libraries determine their own needs); Verizon Comments at 6 (stating that schools are capable of evaluating 
available remote learning services).

other charges not included in the cost of taking such service shall not be covered…”).
136 See, e.g., AT&T Comments at 5 (including installation, taxes, and fees saves time and effort of determining 
ineligible costs); Hughes Comments at 5 (stating that excluding these fees would burden the most cash-strapped 
schools and libraries); NCTA Comments at 5 (arguing that requiring payment of installation costs, taxes, and fees 
would undermine the Congressional objective).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
25microphones.137  We do not dispute that schools and libraries need many of the identified products and 
services, but we believe they are outside the scope of what Congress directed us to support through the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund.  We also deny Verizon’s request to permit the use of Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program support to fund Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA) implementation 
costs.138  The Commission previously determined that E-Rate recipients are statutorily prohibited from 
obtaining discounts under the universal service support mechanism for the purchase or acquisition of 
technology protection measures necessary for CIPA compliance.139  We find that the use of Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program support for implementing CIPA compliance is similarly statutorily barred. 
45. While we find it imperative to focus the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program on the 
equipment and services specified by Congress, we also seek to avoid the challenging cost allocation 
application requirements needed in the E-Rate Program and therefore clarify that any components 
purchased with the eligible equipment and necessary for the equipment to operate, such as cords and 
chargers, do not require cost allocation.140  These minimal costs do not warrant the expense or time of cost 
allocation in an emergency program designed to help students, school staff, and library patrons now.  We 
find this will simplify applications and invoicing, which ultimately will speed funding to schools and

information services); Unisys Reply at 6 (seeking support for cybersecurity software solutions).  We also note that 
commercially available services often include cybersecurity protections.  See, e.g., Jeff Baumgartner, Comcast 
Doubles Download Speeds for ‘Internet Essentials’, Broadband World News (Feb. 2, 2021), 
http://www.broadbandworldnews.com/author.asp?section_id=733&doc_id=767087 (“Comcast has also added its 
cybersecurity product to Internet Essentials for no added cost.”).

26libraries during this emergency.  Consistent with the E-Rate Program, a manufacturer’s multi-year 
warranty for a period up to three years that is provided as an integral part of an eligible component, 
without a separately identifiable cost, may be included in the cost of the component, but unbundled 
warranties are ineligible.141  To further assist applicants with determining eligible equipment and services 
for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, an eligible services list is included as an Appendix to this 
Report and Order.
46. Because the issue was raised in the record, we also clarify that, consistent with the E-Rate 
Program,142 schools and libraries may contract with any service provider or vendor willing to comply with 
the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program rules, not just eligible telecommunications carriers.143  We 
also decline the suggestion of at least one commenter that we exclude providers of broadband services 
that are not participating in the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program from providing eligible services 
in the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.144  While hundreds of broadband providers are 
participating in the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program, some are not, and we do not want to penalize 
schools or libraries for reasons beyond their control.
47.National Security Supply Chain Restrictions.  Finally, we remind Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program participants that, in accord with section 54.10 of the Commission’s rules, 
participants are prohibited from using federal subsidies to purchase, rent, lease, or otherwise obtain any 
covered communications equipment or service from a company identified as posing a national security 
threat to the integrity of communications networks or the communications supply chain.145  We find that 
this prohibition covers Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support, consistent with the determination 
that the prohibition applies to the Universal Service Fund Programs as providing funds for capital 
expenditures necessary for the provision of advanced communications services.146  A list of covered 
equipment and services was posted on the Commission’s website on March 12, 2021 and will be updated 
to reflect any future determinations.147  
D. Service Locations and Per-Location/Per-User Limitations 
48. The American Rescue Plan requires us to adopt regulations providing for the provision of 
support from the Emergency Connectivity Fund to an eligible school or library for the purchase of eligible 
equipment and/or services for use by students, school staff, and library patrons at locations that include

27locations other than the school or library.148  While the Act does not impose any explicit restrictions on 
the number of connections or connected devices supported by the Fund, it requires that reimbursements 
for eligible equipment “not exceed an amount that the Commission determines . . . is reasonable.”149  
Moreover, Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support is provided under section 254(h)(2) of the 
Communications Act, which requires us to consider what is technically feasible and economically 
reasonable when providing support for access to advanced telecommunications and information services 
for eligible schools and libraries.150  Mindful of the importance of maximizing the use of limited funds, 
the Public Notice sought comment on whether we should limit the locations where eligible equipment and 
services may be used or impose per-location or per-user limitations on eligible equipment and services.  
The Public Notice also sought comment on our authority to impose such limitations, if any.151  
49.Eligible Locations.  Recognizing that students, school staff, and library patrons are 
engaged in remote learning activities from a wide variety of off-campus locations that include, but are not 
limited to, their homes, we decline to define or limit the specific off-campus locations where eligible 
equipment and services supported by the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program may be used during the 
COVID-19 emergency period.  We agree with commenters that argue that limiting the off-campus 
locations where eligible equipment and services can be used would be inconsistent with the broad 
language in the Act.152  We also agree with those commenters that argue that schools and libraries are well 
positioned to determine where best to connect their students, school staff, and library patrons.153  
50. We expect that in most instances, the primary off-campus locations where students, 
school staff, and library patrons have been using eligible equipment and services is and—for the duration 
of the emergency period—will be their homes.154  At the same time, the record is clear that there are some

and libraries to determine eligible service locations).  
154 See EducationSuperHighway Comments at 2 (recognizing that student homes have become the classroom during 
the pandemic and asserting that “access to public education hinges on whether a student’s home has broadband 
access”); Wireless Internet Service Providers Association Comments at 6-7 (WISPA Comments) (observing that 
remote learning during the pandemic is “conducted as an extension of the physical classroom, bringing learning that 
would otherwise occur in the school building directly into the home” and supporting the use of funds for the limited 
purpose of educating students at their residences); Andy Boell Comments at 1 (stating that the COVID-19 pandemic 
has redefined where learning occurs from occurring primarily at the school or library to the residences of students 
and library patrons).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
28students, school staff, and library patrons who cannot receive broadband service at home, or for other 
reasons need access at locations other than their homes.  For example, emphasizing the rural nature of 
much of the Navajo Nation and the important role government “anchor institutions” play in Tribal life, 
the Navajo Nation Telecommunications Regulatory Commission stresses the need to permit the 
placement of eligible equipment, like Wi-Fi hotspots, wherever students are engaged in educational 
activities.155  Other commenters explain that restricting where students, school staff, and library patrons 
may use eligible equipment and services could leave the most disadvantaged populations, like the 
unhoused, unconnected, and urge the Commission not to impose restrictions on service locations that 
would exclude these populations.156  We agree.  
51. We therefore will permit eligible schools and libraries to seek and receive support for the 
purchase of eligible equipment and services for use by students, school staff, and library patrons at 
locations that include, but are not limited to, the homes of students, school staff, and library patrons; 
community centers; churches; and any other off-campus locations where they are engaged in remote 
learning activities.157  In so doing, we seek to provide flexibility to eligible schools and libraries to 
determine the service locations that best fit their needs without hampering their ability to undertake 
creative solutions for connecting students, school staff, and library patrons or disadvantaging certain 
vulnerable populations during this unprecedented time.  
52. Notwithstanding this broad interpretation of the Act, and pursuant to our authority under 
section 7402(b) of the Act and section 254(h)(2)(A) of the Communications Act, we prohibit schools and 
libraries from seeking and receiving reimbursement for eligible equipment and services purchased for use 
solely at the school or library.158  Some commenters suggest that the Act may permit funding for eligible 
equipment and services intended solely for on-campus use, pointing to the language in section 7402(a) 
that eligible equipment and services be used at “locations that include locations other than the school” and 
“locations that include locations other than the library.”159  We disagree with this reading of the statutory 
155 NNTRC Comments at 6-7; see also VDOE Comments at 4 (suggesting that the use of Wi-Fi hotspots be 
permitted at locations like apartment buildings, multi-unit housing, water towers, public parks, grocery store parking 
lots, and other community buildings).
156 See Local Governments Comments at 27 (urging the Commission be flexible to ensure that Emergency 
Connectivity Fund funding is available to residents in temporary housing and who are not housed); CETF 
Comments at 16 (raising concerns about restricting service locations because of the potential to exclude unhoused 
persons who lack a location to which to deliver Emergency Connectivity Fund services); CoSN Comments at 7 
(explaining that promoting equitable student broadband access will depend on an applicant’s ability to reach all 
students, including those that do not have permanent homes, move frequently, or rely on emergency locations for 
shelter and care); Cox Reply at 2 (acknowledging that while the majority of students will be engaged in remote 
learning from their homes, “some students – particularly those in our most disadvantaged communities – lack 
permanent homes or live in environments that are not conducive to remote learning” and stressing the need to find 
alternative learning locations (like Boys and Girls Clubs) eligible service locations).
157 The examples we provide are meant to be an illustrative list of the kinds of locations from which we expect the 
vast majority of remote learning activities to occur during the emergency period, but they are by no means meant to 
be an exhaustive list.

29text.  The primary purpose of the Emergency Connectivity Fund is to support off-campus connectivity for 
students, school staff, and library patrons that are unable to benefit from existing connectivity at their 
schools or libraries because of the pandemic, an interpretation supported by the legislative history.160  We 
construe the statute in light of that primary purpose, while not precluding the likely reality of the need for 
some use of the eligible equipment, and perhaps incidental use of mobile services at school and library 
“locations” as well, as long as the eligible equipment and services were purchased to provide off-campus 
access.  We also do not believe that providing Emergency Connectivity Fund support for equipment or 
services to be used solely on campus is reasonable or sound policy in light of the significant need for off-
campus connectivity brought on by the pandemic and considering that the E-Rate Program already 
provides funding to meet students’, school staff, and library patrons’ on-campus connectivity needs.  To 
permit limited funding from the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program to be used to support eligible 
equipment and services solely for on-campus uses would effectively allow schools and libraries to replace 
connections already funded through the E-Rate Program with funding from the Emergency Connectivity 
Fund and to use the Fund to purchase every device used on campus.  We do not believe Congress 
intended such a result.  
53. In particular, we recognize the benefit of being able to use connected devices – laptops 
and tablets – funded through this Program at schools and libraries as schools and libraries begin to 
reopen, and we are sensitive to the need to provide some flexibility during this uncertain time.  If those 
connected devices were purchased for the purpose of providing students, school staff, and library patrons 
with devices for off-campus use consistent with the rules we adopt today, we will not prohibit such on-
campus use.  Fixed wireless and wireline connections purchased with funding from the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund may not, however, be similarly used on-campus given that these connections are 
already eligible for funding under the E-Rate Program.161  While we prohibit the use of funding to 
purchase eligible equipment and services used solely on campus, we remain mindful of the importance of 
robust school and library networks, particularly in rural areas, for the provision of educational and library 
services across the nation.  We are committed to continuing to provide support for these networks through 
the E-Rate Program, and encourage schools and libraries participating in this new Program to continue to 
seek support for their on-campus connectivity needs through the E-Rate Program.162

on-campus connectivity, which is already supported by the E-Rate Program, in light of the clear statutory intent to 
provide connectivity and devices at locations other than the school or library to support remote learning).

161 See supra Section II.B., para. 9 (explaining that the E-Rate Program provides support for connectivity to and 
within schools and libraries).  While we prohibit the on-campus use of eligible equipment and services during the 
emergency period as described above, we provide discretion to schools and libraries to use eligible equipment after 
the emergency period as they see fit, provided that the equipment be used for educational purposes as defined by the 
rules we adopt today.  See infra Section III.L.6, paras. 135-37 (providing for the treatment of eligible equipment and 
services after the COVID-19 emergency period).
162 Indeed, because the pandemic has increased on-campus broadband needs for some schools, last year we opened a 
second, funding year 2020 E-Rate application window to give schools the opportunity to seek E-Rate support to 
purchase additional bandwidth to address needs resulting from the increasing shift to 1:1 student-to-device ratios in 
classrooms, live streaming of classroom instruction to students at home, and expanding use of cloud-based 
educational tools and platforms—all of which can significantly increase on-campus bandwidth requirements.

3054.   Per-Location/Per-User Limitations.  To maximize the use of limited funds, we impose 
certain per-location and per-user limitations on applicants seeking support for eligible equipment and 
services under this Program.  Specifically, we will not permit an eligible school or library to apply for 
support for more than one fixed broadband Internet access connection per location.  Nor will we provide 
support for eligible schools and libraries to purchase more than one connected device and more than one 
Wi-Fi hotspot per student, school staff member, or library patron during the COVID-19 emergency 
period.163  
55. Recognizing that Wi-Fi hotspots can be easily moved and used in different locations, 
while fixed broadband connections are delivered to a specific location, and pursuant to our authority 
under section 7402(b) of the Act and section 254(h)(2)(A) of the Communications Act, we first limit 
support for those costs associated with fixed broadband services to one connection per location, but 
otherwise refrain from imposing a similar per-location limitation on Wi-Fi hotspots.164  We agree with 
those commenters that suggest that while a per-location limitation on fixed broadband services is 
reasonable, a similar limitation on Wi-Fi hotspots would be impractical since many of the Wi-Fi hotspots 
distributed by schools and libraries are insufficient for multiple users and many homes with multiple 
students, school staff, or library patrons could benefit from more than one Wi-Fi hotspot.165  For purposes 
of the per-location limitation we impose on fixed broadband services, we will consider each unit in a 
multi-tenant environment (e.g., apartment buildings) a separate location.
56. Next, with the exception of fixed broadband connections, for which there is a one-per-
location limit, we prohibit schools and libraries from providing more than one supported connection and 
more than one connected device to a student, school staff member, or library patron and clarify that this 
limitation shall apply for the duration of the COVID-19 emergency period.166  That is, during the defined 
emergency period, we will permit eligible schools and libraries to request and receive support for no more 
than one connection and no more than one connected device for each student, school staff member, or 
library patron they serve.  
57. While commenters generally support this approach,167 some argue that there may be 
instances where more than one connected device or connection per user may be appropriate.168  These

31commenters do not, however, provide any specific examples where more than one connected device or 
connection is necessary; and, the one example offered in the record by the American Library Association, 
we find inapposite.169  Specifically, the American Library Association explains that in some cases a parent 
may request two connected devices from a library—one for use of the parent and the other for use of the 
child.170  Because the library in this instance is providing each device for use of one, individual user, we 
consider such use consistent with the per-user limitation we impose on schools and libraries.  As such, we 
are not persuaded by those commenters that suggest that more than one connection or connected device 
per user is necessary, particularly in light of our obligation to limit reimbursements to amounts we find 
reasonable. 
58. Nor are we persuaded that limited funding should be used to allow schools and libraries 
to purchase additional connected devices or other equipment beyond the per-user limitation we set to 
account for equipment damage and breakage.  The Public Notice sought comment on “what allowances or 
controls may be necessary to allow schools and libraries to remediate such issues and how the 
Commission can prevent warehousing of unnecessary equipment and connected devices?”171  While we 
agree with commenters that it is a sensible practice for schools and libraries to purchase some percentage 
of extra devices in preparation for inevitable equipment breakage, we find that limiting support for 
connected devices and Wi-Fi hotspots provided to students, school staff, and library patrons to no more 
than one of each such type of equipment per person is reasonable.172  Were the Emergency Connectivity 
Fund unlimited, we would likely provide support for additional equipment.  To do so under the present 
circumstances would, however, be inconsistent with the goal to provide students, school staff, and library 
patrons with as many needed devices and broadband services as possible in the near term and prevent 
unnecessary warehousing.  
59. In adopting a per-user limitation on these connections and connected devices, we seek to 
equitably distribute and maximize the use of limited funds and the number of students, school staff, and 
library patrons served by this Program.  To further ensure requests for support for connected devices are 
reasonable, in the case of a library, we direct USAC to make inquiries if a library or library system seeks 
reimbursement for more devices than seems reasonable based on the size of the library or library system.

32libraries to document the student(s), school staff member(s), and library patron(s) served at each 
location.173  Because we expect that many schools and libraries are, in the normal course of business, 
already documenting this information, we anticipate that imposing this requirement for purposes of 
participating in the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program will not be an additional burden on most 
applicants.174  Moreover, in requiring schools and libraries to collect and document this information as 
detailed below,175 we acknowledge some comments expressing concerns about protecting the privacy of 
students and library patrons, as well as the confidentiality of library records, and asserting that imposing 
such a requirement on schools and libraries could discourage them from participating in the Program.176  
We are mindful of the need to safeguard the privacy of students, school staff, and library patrons, and we 
commit to ensuring that, if the Commission or USAC staff needs to access this information, for example, 
for audit purposes, they will request and safeguard the information in accordance with the applicable 
privacy laws and guidance.  With this approach, we seek to balance the need to protect limited funds from 
waste, fraud, and abuse and the privacy of students, school staff, and library patrons.
61.Wi-Fi Hotspots on School Buses and Bookmobiles.  Consistent with our decision above 
regarding eligible locations, we allow schools and libraries to use Emergency Connectivity Fund Program 
support to purchase Wi-Fi hotspots for school buses and bookmobiles to provide off-campus broadband 
services to students, school staff, and library patrons who currently lack sufficient broadband access.177  
We find ample support in the record for our action and agree with those commenters that assert that 
deploying Wi-Fi hotspots on schools buses or bookmobiles is a cost-effective means by which to provide 
much-needed connectivity to those students, school staff, and library patrons in areas with limited 
options.178  In addition, we are aware that a number of schools and libraries have already undertaken 
initiatives to equip school buses and bookmobiles with Wi-Fi hotspots during the COVID-19 emergency 
period and have found such initiatives to be particularly effective. 179  As such, during the second

the relevant time period. 
E. Eligible Uses 
62. Consistent with the goal of funding the connections and devices needed for remote 
learning embodied in section 7402(a) of the American Rescue Plan and section 254(h)(1)(B) of the 
Communications Act, and with the E-Rate program, we require that equipment and services supported by 
the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program be used primarily for educational purposes.  Although the text 
of section 7402 of the American Rescue Plan is silent on permitted uses of equipment and services 
eligible for Emergency Connectivity Fund support, that section of the Act is entitled “Funding for E-Rate 
Support for Emergency Educational Connections and Devices.”180  Moreover, it provides that the 
Commission promulgate rules for the provision of funding consistent with sections 254(h)(1)(B) and (2) 
of the Communications Act, and section 254(h)(1)(B) of the Communications Act requires 
telecommunications carriers to provide services to schools and libraries for “educational purposes.”181  As 
a result, our E-Rate rules require schools and libraries to use E-Rate-supported services “primarily for 
educational purposes.”182  Educational purposes, in turn, are defined as “activities that are integral, 
immediate, and proximate to the education of students” in the case of schools and activities that are 
“integral, immediate, and proximate to the provision of library services to library patrons” in the case of 
libraries.183  We take that same approach here.
63. For purposes of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, we therefore define 
“educational purposes” as activities that are integral, immediate, and proximate to the education of 
students in the case of a school, and activities that are integral, immediate, and proximate to the provision 
of library services to library patrons in the case of a library.  And, we require schools and libraries to use 
eligible equipment and services supported by this Program primarily for educational purposes, but still 
limit use to students, school staff, and library patrons as intended by Congress.  Because we require 
eligible equipment and services be used primarily for educational purposes, as defined in section 54.500 
of our rules, in the case of schools, we emphasize that the provision of eligible equipment and services for 
school staff is limited to school staff that will be providing (or provided) educational services during the 
relevant time periods and would otherwise lack access to connected devices or broadband connections 
sufficient to facilitate remote learning during the pandemic.184  
64. We recognize that some commenters would prefer that schools and libraries be able to 
use eligible equipment and services for any purpose they see fit.185  At least one commenter suggests that 
we adopt a presumption that all off-campus use of eligible equipment and services is an “educational

184 See infra Section III.G, para. 78 (limiting funding to meet the needs of students, school staff, and library patrons

185 See, e.g., CoSN Comments at 7 (recommending that the Commission not require eligible equipment and services 
be used only for educational purposes and instead defer to school district practices); Local Governments Comments 
at 28 (proposing that schools and libraries be able to use equipment and services for any purpose that the school or 
library deems appropriate).  Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
34use.”186  Others argue that we should allow eligible equipment and services to be used for broader 
purposes without imposing any constraints or giving priority to educational uses, including for 
professional development and to support household connectivity that provides access to a variety of 
Internet resources, not just educational or library resources or limited to the intended users specified in the 
Act.187  In requesting such expansive uses for eligible equipment and services, commenters ignore the fact 
that the Congressional reason for establishing the Emergency Connectivity Fund was to fund emergency 
educational connections and devices, as reflected in the title of section 7402 of the American Rescue Plan, 
for use by students, school staff, and library patrons.188  What is more, such arguments, when taken to an 
extreme, are also an invitation to waste, fraud, and abuse.  
65. At the same time, we are sensitive to the critical need students, school staff, and library 
patrons have for broadband connections and devices for any number of important and productive uses 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the need to provide schools and libraries with as much 
flexibility as possible to meet the unique remote learning needs of students, school staff, and library 
patrons.  We also recognize that even the most ardent student will not be using his or her connected 
device and broadband connection to attend classes and do schoolwork all day every day, and that library 
patrons use the broadband services at libraries for an enormous variety of purposes.  We therefore find 
that it is only reasonable that schools and libraries be given the flexibility to allow the use of eligible 
equipment and services for other purposes when they are not needed for educational purposes in the first 
instance.  We conclude that requiring that eligible equipment and services supported by the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program be used primarily for educational purposes strikes the right balance.  It will 
ensure that such equipment and services are first and foremost used to facilitate remote learning, as 
intended by Congress, while also allowing them to be used for other purposes for the benefit of students, 
school staff, and library patrons.  
66. To ensure that connected devices supported by this Program are used primarily for 
educational purposes and by students, school staff, and library patrons, we require schools and libraries to 
restrict access to eligible connected devices to only those students, school staff, and library patrons with 
appropriate credentials.  The Miami-Dade County Public Schools, in response to the question in the 
Public Notice, confirms in its comments that it already requires appropriate credentials, and we expect 
other schools and libraries are doing the same.189  We thus find that imposing such a restriction will not 
impose an additional burden on most applicants and is an important safeguard to ensure that connected 
devices supported by this Program are used for their intended purpose and by intended users.  In addition 
requiring schools and libraries to restrict access to the connected devices they provide for use by students, 
school staff, and library patrons helps protect the privacy of those users by limiting access to any 
information they have stored on such devices. 
186 See SHLB Comments at 12-13 (arguing that the Commission need not adopt specific rules governing the use of 
equipment and suggesting that the Commission presume that any equipment or service purchased with funding from 
the Emergency Connectivity Fund is for “educational purposes”).
187 See, e.g., Alaska Communications Comments at 3; City of San Jose Comments at 4; see also H.R. 1319, tit. VII, 
§ 7402(a)(1)-(2) (specifying that eligible equipment and services be for use by students, school staff, and library 
patrons). 
188 At least one commenter urges the Commission to clarify that “patron of the library” under Section 7402(a)(2) of 
the Act includes library staff.  See T-Mobile Comments at 7.  While library staff are not explicitly included in the 
statute, we recognize that most library staff are, of course, also library patrons, and we therefore will consider such 
staff to be library patrons for purposes of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  See H.R. 1319, tit. VII, § 
7402(a)(2).
189 See, e.g., M-DCPS Comments at 3 (explaining that Miami-Dade County Public Schools currently require user 
credentials for students, staff, and school-based tutors, as well as for parents, to access the network, as well 
credentialing for Wi-Fi users).  Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
3567. Recognizing that it may not always be technically possible to similarly restrict access for 
other eligible equipment and eligible services supported by this Program, we encourage, but do not 
require, schools and libraries to take the same approach for the use of other eligible equipment and 
services.  We find that restricting access in this way is a best practice and will help ensure that eligible 
services are provided to students, school staff, and library patrons, as provided for by the Act.
F. Reasonable Support Amount 
68. We next establish a range of costs that are presumed reasonable for eligible connected 
devices and Wi-Fi hotspots and direct USAC to limit funding commitments for each type of equipment or 
device to the maximum amount deemed reasonable.  We also establish an application review process for 
considering the reasonableness of other types of eligible equipment and services.  In the E-Rate Program, 
competitive bidding and the requirement to use price as the primary factor help ensure cost-effective 
purchasing.  As discussed in greater detail below, because we are providing support for purchases made 
during the pandemic without requiring a competitive bidding process, those protections do not exist here.  
Moreover, schools and libraries purchased these equipment and services, often on short notice and during 
a time when demand was high for tablets, laptops, and Wi-Fi hotspots, and supply chains were disrupted 
leading some schools and libraries to pay premium prices for needed equipment.190  At the same time, we 
are mindful that the Emergency Connectivity Fund, while substantial, is insufficient to meet the entire 
need of the nation’s schools and libraries for eligible devices and services.191  Congress therefore directed 
us to reimburse 100% of the costs associated with eligible equipment and services, “except that any 
reimbursement of a school or library for the costs associated with any eligible equipment may not exceed 
an amount that the Commission determines, with respect to the request by the school or library for 
reimbursement, is reasonable.”192  Read in conjunction with section 254(h)(2)(A) of the Communications 
Act’s direction that services be “technically feasible and economically reasonable,” we adopt reasonable 
support amounts for connected devices and Wi-Fi hotspots and a framework to determine unreasonable 
costs for other eligible equipment and services supported under this Program.193
69. For connected devices and Wi-Fi hotspots, the two types of eligible equipment for which 
we expect to see the most requests for support through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, we 
adopt per-device caps based on a reasonable support amount, up to which an applicant may receive 
support.  Adopting these reasonable maximum support amounts will provide the simplest review process 
for applications requesting these two types of equipment, although applicants will be reimbursed based on 
the actual costs of the equipment.  First, after consideration of the record, we find that $400 is a 
reasonable, maximum support amount for connected devices.194  In response to the Remote Learning 
Public Notice, commenters discussed costs of between $160 and $650, and just under $300 for iPads.195  
190 See, e.g., ESU #9 Comments at 3 (noting that high demand at the pandemic start meant high prices).
191 See, e.g., EducationSuperHighway Comments at 4-5; Common Sense Comments at 4 (both citing the Common 
Sense Media 2021 Report estimating $6 to $11 billion in initial need and $4 to $8 billion in annual costs thereafter).

36Here, stakeholders support a reimbursement limit between $300 and $750 per device to ensure that the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund is not used entirely to support a limited number of expensive connected 
devices196 and to allow the Program to support the much-needed connectivity for students, school staff, 
and library patrons.197  One commenter suggests that $500 is more than sufficient to cover the most 
commonly used connected devices,198 while another representing states across the country determined that 
$300 per device reflects a reasonable allowance based on knowledge of procurements over the last year.199  
However, after consideration of the record, $400 is a reasonable amount to reimburse for the vast majority 
of the devices suggested in the record, consistent with limits other programs have used.200  We also elect a 
maximum support amount of $400 in order to ensure funding is available equitably, does not 
unintentionally provide more support to schools and libraries that had greater access to funds, and 
increases the likelihood of available funds for those schools and libraries with continuing unmet needs.  
To be clear, applicants that spend more than $400 per connected device may seek support of $400 for 
each such device.201
70. We recognize that in some instances $400 may not be a reasonable maximum cost for a 
connected device that meets the needs of some people with disabilities.202  Applicants may request a 
waiver of the reasonable support amount for connected devices, if the reasonable cost to purchase devices 
for students, school staff, or patrons with disabilities is higher than $400 and the public interest warrants 
deviation from the general rule.  We emphasize that applicants seeking a waiver for this purpose should 
demonstrate that the additional cost associated with connected devices for those with disabilities is 
necessary to meet the needs of students, school staff, and library patrons with disabilities that would

37$250 in support for such devices.  This maximum allowable cost is for the equipment itself, and we 
expect applicants to separately seek support for the cost of the service provided using the hotspot device.
72. For the other types of eligible equipment—namely, modems, routers, and devices that 
combine modems and routers—we do not at this time have a sufficient record to determine a reasonable 
maximum support amount, nor do we expect to receive requests totaling a substantial amount of the Fund.  
We therefore direct USAC to carefully review the requests and identify applications that are out of line 
with the funding requests of other applicants.  We delegate authority to the Bureau to provide guidance to 
USAC for assessing the reasonability of those applications based on the universe of requests for 
reimbursement for similar equipment and on applicants’ justifications for their requests.  We recognize 
that costs may be higher because of supply chain issues at the start of the pandemic,204 or geographic 
differences,205 and we expect applicants to be prepared to explain their selections and costs, as needed, to 
be eligible for 100% reimbursement.  
73. Consistent with this approach for eligible equipment and the requirements under section 
254(h)(2)(A) that the Commission provide access to services to the extent technically feasible and 
economically reasonable,206 we also direct USAC to review applications for commercially available 
advanced telecommunications and information services and identify the applications with outlying costs.  
We delegate authority to the Bureau to provide guidance to USAC on how to determine the 
reasonableness of such costs.  Based on the record before us, we expect that most of the applications for 
support for broadband Internet access services will be for services purchased under bulk purchase 
agreements, and we expect services to generally be in the range suggested by commenters between $10 
and $25 per month.207 
74. At the same time, we recognize that not all schools and libraries will be able to benefit 
from such bulk purchasing arrangements and pricing for broadband services varies widely across our 
nation based on the availability of competitive options, rurality, and other factors.208  In assessing the 
reasonableness of costs for broadband Internet access services, particularly in rural locations, USAC and 
the Bureau should make use of the reasonable comparability benchmarks established for the High Cost 
Universal Service Support Program.209  The Bureau and the Office of Economics and Analytics publishes 
an updated reasonable comparability benchmark annually, including Alaska-specific benchmarks.210

3875. We are mindful of the many valid concerns expressed in the record that there may be 
insufficient funding available for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program to fully support the 
emergency connectivity and device needs of all eligible schools and libraries across the nation.211  In 
recognition of the concerns that reimbursement could be slow or uncertain, we aim throughout this Report 
and Order to implement Program rules and processes that help applicants easily apply for funding and 
receive support as quickly as possible.212  
76. We have carefully considered, but do not adopt here, the recommendation made by many 
commenters that instead of imposing reasonable maximum support amounts by type of eligible equipment 
and service, we set funding amounts for schools based on the number of students in a school, and for 
libraries based on their square footage, with some adjustments for higher poverty or more rural 
applicants.213  This is the basic model used for determining the amount of funding provided to schools and 
libraries that apply for E-Rate support for internal connections (category two services).214

3977. We agree with commenters that budgets have been a successful approach to funding 
category two services.215  The commenters supporting a similar budget approach for apportioning the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund, however, fail to acknowledge that those category two budgets were 
adopted after a lengthy rulemaking and analysis of the costs of deploying internal connections within 
schools and libraries.216  While these category two budgets do not precisely meet the costs of each 
applicant, they were established with a goal of meeting every school and library’s need for category two 
services over the course of a five-year budget cycle using available data on the costs and network needs 
and made permanent after careful examination of the budget amounts.217  Here, we lack sufficient data or 
estimates to make such determinations and instead find commenters’ suggested budget levels218 to largely 
be focused on dividing the appropriated funds with slight differences to account for income or rurality.219  
Had Congress wished to provide a set amount of funding to each school and library in the country, it 
could have easily done so.220  Instead, the American Rescue Plan clearly states that the Commission shall 
reimburse 100% of the costs associated with the eligible equipment and services, subject to a 
determination of what constitutes reasonable equipment costs, and suggestions that the Commission 
implement applicant budgets is simply inconsistent with this direction.  
G. Application Process 
78. We adopt an application process that first provides funding to schools and libraries for 
purchases during the coming school year of eligible equipment and services for use by students, school 
staff, and library patrons who would otherwise lack access to eligible equipment or services sufficient to 
engage in remote learning and virtual library services.  As discussed further below, during this first 
application window, applicants will be able to submit requests for funding for purchases made between 
July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022, which aligns with the coming school year and the E-Rate funding year, 
with which schools and libraries are very familiar.  Then, if there are remaining funds after this initial 
application window, we will open a second application window for schools and libraries to seek funding 
for eligible equipment and services they previously purchased to address the needs of students, school 
staff, and library patrons who would otherwise have lacked access to the equipment or services sufficient 
to engage in these activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.  During this second application window, 
215 See, e.g., E-Rate Central Comments at 3 (discussing the category two budget mechanism “with a slight twist”); 
FFL Comments at 7-8 (stating that the category two budget approach was an improvement on the priority two 
system, which funded applications based on discount rate).

at 15571-78, Section III.A. (adopting the category two budget approach for a five-year test period to fund internal 
connections within schools and libraries).

budgets based on student enrollment, E-Rate discount level, and a $157 budget multiplier, or a $4.50 multiplier for 
libraries using square footage to allocate $6.8 million in funding, with the rest of funding allocated to special 
projects that do not fit within the budgets); SECA Comments at 5 (recommending budget multipliers of $100 and 
$150 per student, depending on rural designation, and $2.00 and $3.00 for library square foot, depending on rural 
designation).

40applicants will be able to submit requests for funding for purchases made from March 1, 2020 to June 30, 
2021.  However, in consideration of the importance of providing support for unconnected students, in the 
event that demand for prospective support in the first window appears to be far short of meeting current 
needs, the Commission may consider opening a second prospective window before opening an 
application window to fund previously purchased eligible equipment and services.
79. In adopting this approach, we are particularly cognizant of the substantial remaining 
unmet need for connected devices and broadband Internet access services among students, school staff, 
and library patrons.  We also recognize that a significant amount of other federal funding has been made 
available to schools to assist with digital learning (although schools have had the option to use that 
funding to meet a plethora of other pressing needs as well) through both the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and 
Economic Security (CARES) Act last year, as well as other provisions of the American Rescue Plan 
Act.221  The approach we take in prioritizing existing unmet need, followed by a funding window 
providing support for previous purchases during the pandemic, is consistent with the suggestion made by 
those commenters who support prioritizing future purchases, as well as those who support allowing 
applicants to request support for both past and future purchases.222  Some other commenters support 
allowing requests only for purchases made after the date of this Order,223 others support prioritizing prior 
purchases,224 and still others support opening a single application window providing support for past and 
future purposes.225  We recognize that there is some merit to these other approaches.  In particular, we see

41the appeal of using the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program to first reimburse those schools and 
libraries that have already paid for eligible equipment and services to meet the needs of their students, 
school staff, and library patrons by prioritizing past purchases.226  On balance, however, we find that 
doing so would not be the best use of public funds because it would create a risk that we would have 
insufficient funding available to provide support for connected devices and broadband Internet access 
services for students, school staff, and library patrons who otherwise will not have access to devices and 
connectivity sufficient to meet their remote learning needs during the coming school year.  Adopting a 
single funding window for past and future purchases creates the same risk, and imposes substantial 
administrative burdens on schools and libraries and on USAC.
80.   As discussed above, section 7402(a) requires that we promulgate rules for the provision 
of support under sections 254(h)(1)(B) and (h)(2) of the Communications Act.227  Section 254(h)(2) of the 
Communications Act, in turn, requires us to consider what is technically feasible and economically 
reasonable when providing support for advanced telecommunications and information services.228  Given 
this statutory direction, as well as the limited funding available under the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program, we therefore find it reasonable to prioritize support to connect those students, school staff, and 
library patrons that would otherwise lack sufficient connectivity to benefit from remote learning this 
coming school year.  In so doing, we are also mindful of the purpose of the Fund and Congress’ intent to 
address the connectivity needs of students, school staff, and library patrons who would otherwise be 
unable to access educational and library services due to the pandemic.229  
81. To ensure that funding is focused on unmet need, we will require schools to certify, as 
part of their funding application, that they are only seeking support for eligible equipment provided to 
students and school staff who would otherwise lack access to connected devices sufficient to engage in 
remote learning.  We will also require schools to certify, as part of their funding application, that they are 
only seeking support for eligible services provided to students and school staff who would otherwise lack 
broadband services sufficient to engage in remote learning.  This should not be an onerous burden, as the 
record shows that many school districts have conducted needs assessments to determine the connectivity 
needs of their students and staff.230  We think that schools are in the best position to determine whether

connected going into 2021” and “[a]dditional federal funding will ensure that students and low-income Americans 
have access to reliable high-speed internet in locations other than schools and libraries through different 
technological solutions”) (emphasis added).  We recognize that many school districts operate 1:1 device initiatives 
and may provide devices to all students regardless of need.  In light of the admittedly substantial, but still limited, 
funding available through the Emergency Connectivity Fund, we do not think it is appropriate to support the 
purchase of devices or services for students that already have access to an adequate device.  
230 See, e.g., ESU # 9 Comments at 5 (describing Nebraska’s efforts to conduct consistent needs assessments);

42their students and staff have devices and broadband services sufficient to meet their remote learning 
needs, and we recognize that they are making such decisions in the midst of a pandemic.  We, therefore, 
will not impose any specific metrics or process requirements on those determinations, but we expect 
schools to take reasonable measures to determine need, avoid duplicating support provided by other 
programs such as the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program, and document need to the extent they do 
not already do so.231     
82. We recognize that libraries do not usually inquire about the needs of their patrons before 
providing services.232  They do, however, typically have acceptable use policies governing patron use of 
library computers and Wi-Fi hotspots.233  To ensure that libraries are providing eligible equipment and 
services to patrons with unmet needs, we therefore require that on a going forward basis before providing 
a library patron with eligible equipment or services, for which the library is seeking Emergency 
Connectivity Fund support, the library must provide the patron a copy of an eligible use policy, which 
explains that the equipment or service is intended for library patrons who do not otherwise have access to 
equipment or services sufficient to meet the patron’s educational needs.  On a going forward basis, we 
also require that the library patron sign and return a statement that the library patron would otherwise lack 
access to equipment or services sufficient to meet the patron’s educational needs if not for the use of the 
equipment or service being provided by the library. 
83.Initial Emergency Connectivity Fund Program Application Filing Window.  To speed the 
availability of funds to schools and libraries during the public health emergency, we direct USAC to open 
an initial 45-day Emergency Connectivity Fund Program filing window as soon as practicable.  During 
this initial Emergency Connectivity Fund Program filing window, eligible schools and libraries may 
apply for funding for the purchase of eligible equipment and services made between July 1, 2021 and 
June 30, 2022 and provided during that time period to students, school staff and library patrons who still 
lack access to adequate connected devices, other eligible equipment or eligible services.  We include 
within this first window, only eligible equipment ordered by and received, as well as only services 
delivered by June 30, 2022.234    
84. We find that a 45-day application window will provide sufficient time for schools and 
libraries to apply for reimbursement.  We considered the suggestion of some commenters that a 30-day 
application filing window would be sufficient,235 but we are mindful that this is a new program, the 
application window will be open during the summer, and school staff have much to do to get schools 
(Continued from previous page)  
an educational device, as well as estimate the number of students still lacking home broadband or an educational 
device).
231 We do not agree with the suggestion of some commenters that there should be a presumption of unmet need 
when a school pays for a device or broadband connection for a low-income student.  See, e.g., Remote Learning 
Coalition Ex Parte at 5.  As we recognized above, schools, libraries and other groups have made great strides in 
meeting the needs of students for connected devices and broadband connections during the pandemic, so such a 
presumption would be overinclusive.  
232 See ALA Reply at 3 (stating that libraries generally have not collected detailed information about patrons who 
lack connectivity or a device during the pandemic).

43ready for the upcoming school year.  We also considered suggestions that the filing window be longer,236 
but this is an “emergency” program.  Closing the window after 45 days will allow USAC to quickly size 
demand, review applications, and release funding commitment decision letters – ensuring that funding 
from the Emergency Connectivity Fund will begin to flow to eligible applicants within a short period of 
time.
85.Additional Application Filing Windows.  If demand does not exceed available funds for 
the first application period and the Commission does not open a second prospective window, we delegate 
authority to the Bureau to direct USAC to open additional application filing windows until the funds are 
exhausted or the emergency period ends, whichever is earlier.  We recognize that there will be a point at 
which the administrative costs to applicants and USAC of opening an application process for a relatively 
small amount of remaining funds is not cost-effective and delegate authority to the Bureau, after 
consultation with the Office of the Managing Director and USAC, to determine when that point has been 
reached. 
86. In setting a start date for purchases that are reimbursable through the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program in the second application filing window, we agree with commenters that urge 
the Commission to use March 1, 2020 as the starting date for the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program.237  Although January 27, 2020 is the date the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
retroactively determined that a public health emergency existed as a result of COVID-19 pursuant to 
section 319 of the Public Health Service Act,238 and section 7402 states that our regulations should 
provide for the provision of support for purchases “during a COVID-19 emergency period,” we view that 
language as giving us discretion to determine the appropriate funding period for purchases made during 
the COVID-19 emergency period.  While some commenters suggest using July 1, 2020 as a start date for 
eligibility for Emergency Connectivity Fund support for administrative ease,239 we agree with those 
commenters that argue that it will be fairer to applicants that acted quickly, once they became aware of 
the looming pandemic, to use March 1, 2020 as the starting date based on when schools began sending 
students home because of the pandemic.240  As the Remote Learning Coalition points out, every state in 
the nation began closing schools in March 2020.241  Given the statutory goal of meeting the need of 
students, school staff, and library patrons for connectivity during the pandemic, allowing reimbursement 
for purchases made beginning on the first day of the month when schools began to close because of the 
pandemic helps ensure that we provide support that is tied to needs arising from the pandemic.

apply); South Carolina Comments at 9 (recommending a rolling application period until funds are fully committed).

4487.Competitive Bidding Requirements.  We allow eligible schools and libraries to seek 
reimbursement for the cost of eligible equipment and services purchased without having conducted a 
Commission-mandated competitive bidding process for purposes of the Emergency Connectivity Fund.242  
Based on the record before us, we conclude that it is appropriate in light of the emergency, rather than 
adopting an Emergency Connectivity Fund competitive bidding process, to require schools and libraries 
seeking funding from the Emergency Connectivity Fund to certify that they have complied with all 
applicable local, state, and Tribal procurement requirements with respect to both previous purchases and 
future purchases and contracts.243  This requires schools and libraries that are not subject to public 
procurement rules to follow their own procurement process and rules, such as those that may be included 
in a written charter.
88. For purchases that have already been made and contracts that have already been 
executed, it is impractical to attempt to impose Commission-specific competitive bidding or other 
contract restrictions on such purchases,244 and we are also persuaded that compliance with local, state, and 
Tribal procurement requirements offer significant protections against waste, fraud and abuse.245  Schools 
and libraries have been asked to take incredible steps at great cost this year in order to facilitate remote 
learning and keep their communities connected, and they did so without the knowledge of whether such 
expenses would be reimbursed.  While such expenses will still be reviewed to ensure the costs were 
reasonable, we are convinced that we can rely on the local, state, and Tribal procurement requirements as 
a check on unreasonable spending.  For purchases made after the date of this Report and Order, some 
stakeholders recommend a streamlined competitive bidding approaches, ranging from just minor 
modifications to the E-Rate competitive bidding rules to a shortened 14-day competitive bidding 
window.246  Given the emergency nature of this funding, as well as the ability of the Commission to 
review and reject the requests for unreasonable costs, we are convinced that compliance with local, state, 
and Tribal procurement regulations will sufficiently safeguard the Program for future purchases and 
decline to adopt a streamlined competitive bidding process for the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program.  
89. We also clarify that schools and libraries may seek support from the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program for the purchase of eligible services and equipment using existing bulk 
purchase programs or sponsored service agreements, so long as doing so is consistent with the relevant 
242 See Public Notice at 10.
243 See, e.g., SECA Comments at 9-10 (stating that state and local requirements offer sufficient protections and that 
additional federal competitive bidding requirements will not likely control costs, particularly when many of these 
particular equipment and services are standard offerings with prices in a well-known range of reasonableness); 
Verizon Comments at 12-13 (stating that additional competitive bidding requirements “are ill-suited to the 
emergency needs of students who lack connectivity during the pandemic”).  
244 See, e.g., FFL Comments at 11 (seeking clarity that a signed contract is not required prior to filing an application 
for Emergency Connectivity Fund support).
245 See, e.g., EdLiNC Comments at 10 (recommending the use of state and local procurement rules only for the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund as sufficient); E-mpa Comments at 4 (recommending certification to state and local 
rules due to the exigent nature of the crisis); SECA Comments at 9-10; SHLB Comments at 13 (agreeing that state 
and local procurement rules in place ensure reasonable rates).
246 See, e.g., AT&T Comments at 6 (recommending a competitive bidding requirement mirroring that in the E-Rate 
Program and including filing a simplified FCC Form 470 with the applicants’ high-level procurement goals); AT&T 
Reply at 7-8 (arguing that a streamlined competitive bidding process will ensure the integrity of the funding and will 
not delay disbursement); FFL Comments at 11 (recommending that applicants file an FCC Form 470 seeking bids 
for services, but removing the requirement that applicants wait 28 days to enter a legally binding agreement); T-
Mobile Comments at 15 (suggesting a 14-day window for a streamlined competitive bidding process); WISPA 
Comments at 7-9 (recommending reducing the waiting time to 14-days, but keeping a competitive bidding process 
to make support available fairly and quickly with all providers having the opportunity to participate).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
45local, state and Tribal procurement regulations.247  Unlike the traditional E-Rate Program, which funds 
broadband connectivity to a single school or district of schools and therefore generally only funds service 
from the single most cost-effective service provider, the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program is aimed 
at connecting numerous students, school staff, and library patrons at their homes or other locations, and 
therefore a school district or library system appropriately may have agreements with multiple service 
providers to offer connectivity.248  At the same time, we decline to adopt the suggestion made by at least 
one commenter that we require school districts to select multiple existing providers,249 or set requirements 
for solicitation,250 finding that flexibility is appropriate under the circumstances.  We also remind 
applicants that only eligible schools and libraries may seek reimbursement for such costs, and therefore a 
non-profit organization or other entity that arranged for such bulk purchases is not eligible for 
reimbursement through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.251 
90.Leveraging E-Rate Processes and Forms.  As commenters strongly support, we direct 
USAC to leverage the existing E-Rate application, i.e., FCC Form 471 (Description of Services Ordered 
and Certification Form) and other E-Rate processes to the extent feasible for the Emergency Connectivity 
Fund Program.252  Schools and libraries are already familiar with these processes and will be able to apply 
more easily than if an entirely new system is developed using different forms and processes.  We also 
expect that leveraging E-Rate processes and forms will likely reduce administrative costs and delays in 
the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program and ensure that Emergency Connectivity Fund Program 
support is quickly released to schools and libraries.
91.Prioritization.  In the event that demand exceeds available funds during any Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program application filing window, we will prioritize requests based on applicants’ E-
Rate Program discount rate for category one services, adjusted to provide a five percent bump up for rural 
schools and libraries.253  Those schools and libraries entitled to a higher discount will receive funding 
ahead of those entitled to a lower discount rate.  In the event there is insufficient funding to meet the need 
at a particular discount rate, we will prioritize within the discount rate based on the percentage of free and

Marlene H. Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 21-93, at 4 (filed May 5, 2021) (seeking additional competitive 
bidding requirements regarding solicitation of interest and contracting).
251 See, e.g., National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors Reply at 2-5 (seeking support for 
bulk purchasing programs, even when procured by local governments).
252 See, e.g., FFL Comments at 1-3 (stating that leveraging the existing E-Rate Program will increase the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund likelihood of success, reduce burdens on applicants, and reduce operating expenses); Milwaukee 
Public Library Comments at 4 (agreeing that familiarity with the forms will be easier for applicants, but also 
recommending a simpler form); Qualcomm Comments at 20 (relying “on the existing E-Rate program to the greatest 
extent possible [will] ensure the quickest rollout of support”). 
253 See Public Notice at 12; see, e.g., Benton Comments at 5 (supporting the application of the E-Rate Program 
discount methodology to prioritize funding requests, if demand exceeds available funding); CCA Comments at 9 
(agreeing that the E-Rate Program discount methodology is a sensible prioritization approach); M-DCPS Comments 
at 4 (recommending use of the E-Rate prioritization method, rather than creating a new method).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
46reduced lunch eligible students, consistent with the rules for the E-Rate Program.254  Commenters suggest 
using assorted variations on the E-Rate discount matrix or a set-aside to reflect need in rural or Tribal 
areas, or special education programs and services.255  Adjusting the discount matrix to increase the 
likelihood of rural schools and libraries receiving funding in the event that demand exceeds available 
funds, will provide a more equitable geographic distribution of available funds,256 particularly in light of 
the higher cost of residential broadband services in many rural areas and the extraordinary circumstances 
of the pandemic.257  We decline suggestions that we provide a prorated amount of funding to all applicants 
that apply for support, finding instead that prioritizing by the discount rates provides a better method to 
prioritize the needs of high poverty and rural schools and libraries.258  We find that the approach we adopt 
today balances the goal of targeting funding to the students, school staff, and library patrons with the 
greatest need with the goal of maximizing administrative efficiency by adjusting existing E-Rate Program 
standards rather than creating whole new processes just for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.259
H. Invoicing and Reimbursement Process 
92. As discussed above, one of the goals we adopt for the Program is to efficiently and 
effectively administer funding, which will be measured in part by the speed and ease of the 
reimbursement process.260  Consistent with that goal, we establish a streamlined invoicing process for 
applicants and service providers to submit requests for reimbursement, leveraging existing E-Rate forms 
to reduce administrative burdens where possible, while providing effective safeguards against waste, 
fraud, and abuse.
93.Submission of Reimbursement Requests.  As part of this streamlined process, we allow 
applicants and service providers to submit requests for reimbursement.  We agree with those commenters 
that explain allowing both applicant and service provider invoicing options is the most efficient and direct 
way to get much needed funding to eligible schools and libraries.261  We see no reason not to send the 
254 See 47 CFR § 54.507.
255 See, e.g., Colville Confederated Tribes Comments at 3 (recommending a percentage of the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund be set aside for Tribal use); NNTRC Comments at 5-6 (supporting prioritization based on the 
discount level and also recommending that at least seven percent of the Fund be set aside for Tribal lands); ZP 
Better Together, LLC Comments at 2 (recommending prioritization, or at a minimum, ensuring access for students 
with disabilities).

257 See, e.g., Alaska DEED Comments at 6-7; West Virginia Department of Education Reply at 4-5.
258 See, e.g., Remote Learning Coalition Ex Parte at 3-4 (seeking an across-the-board percentage proration if 
necessary).
259 See, e.g., FFL Comments at 7 (discussing how household income level is the most significant factor in 
identifying the percentage of school age children who lack adequate Internet access).  
260 See supra Section III.A.2, para. 21.
261 See, e.g., SHLB Comments at 14 (asserting that the Commission should allow either the school or library or 
vendor to submit an invoice for reimbursement so that the school or library does not have to pay for the entire 
upfront costs of a project); SETDA Comments at 6 (expressing support for a flexible method of reimbursement); 
ENA Comments at 18 (stating that applicants should be permitted to choose either the BEAR or the SPI method of 
invoicing as in the E-Rate Program); EdLiNC Comments at 11 (urging the Commission to ensure maximum 
flexibility by retaining the option for both vendors and schools and libraries to submit invoices); ALA May 6 Ex 
Parte at 3 (explaining that “allowing both BEAR and SPI invoicing options will increase library participation in the 
ECF Program”); Letter from Whitney Silverman, National Association of Independent Schools et al to Marlene H. 
Dortch, Secretary, FCC, WC Docket No. 21-93, at 2 (filed May 4, 2021) (requesting that service providers be 
allowed to invoice for the Emergency Connectivity Program to facilitate private and independent school 
participation in the program). Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
47actual funds to the service provider where the applicant and service provider have both consented to that 
approach and the applicant can show that the contractual obligation exists.  As part of the invoicing 
process, applicants and service providers must provide required certifications, along with any necessary 
documentation to support their requests.  We clarify that applicants may use consultants and service 
providers to assist with the preparation of their reimbursement requests to the extent necessary, but any 
fees associated with such assistance are not eligible for funding under the Program.
94. In addition, we are also sympathetic to concerns raised by commenters that applicants 
may not be able to cover the upfront costs associated with eligible equipment and services.  We therefore 
will allow applicants who have entered into contractual arrangements or are otherwise legally obligated to 
purchase eligible equipment and services from their service provider, to submit requests for 
reimbursement before they have paid for the requested equipment and services.262  Applicants must pay 
their service provider within 30 days after receipt of funds and will be required to certify compliance and 
provide verification of payment to the service provider.263 
95. Although we allow applicants to request that their service providers submit invoices for 
payment from the Emergency Connectivity Fund, we do not require service providers to accept that 
responsibility.264  At this juncture, we expect that applicants and service providers may have already 
entered into contracts for much of the eligible equipment and services to be purchased in the coming 
school year, and service providers would not have entered into those contracts expecting to have 
responsibility for invoicing the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  At the same time, if requested to 
do so by the school or library, some service providers may be willing to invoice the federal government 
rather than the school or library for payment.  We therefore conclude on balance that allowing both 
options for submission of Emergency Connectivity Fund Program reimbursement requests is an efficient 
and effective way to ensure that applicants are actually able to purchase the eligible equipment and 
services.  For administrative simplicity, applicants must specify at the application stage whether the 
applicant or service provider will be doing the invoicing.  If an applicant indicates that the service 
provider will be doing the invoicing, the applicant will have to submit evidence of the service provider’s 
willingness to do so.
96.Documentation.  To protect against waste, fraud, and abuse of the Fund, we will require 
applicants and service providers to submit, along with their reimbursement requests, invoices detailing the 
items purchased.  Invoices must support the amounts requested in the application form and 
reimbursement request.  We agree with commenters that suggest submission of invoices with 
reimbursement requests is sufficient in most instances and will help expedite review of reimbursement 
requests and the disbursement of funds.265  While we will not require applicants and service providers to 
262 See, e.g., SECA Comments at 19-20 (proposing that applicants be allowed to request up-front payments for 
eligible equipment and services and be required to submit verification that the service provider was paid after receipt 
of funds); Remote Learning Coalition Ex Parte at 4 (arguing that applicants should be able to invoice after making a 
payment or issuing a purchase order based on a contract with verification that payment was made to the service 
provider); SECA May 6 Ex Parte at 2 (same).
263 See 47 CFR § 54.1711(a)(1)(v), (b).
264 By contrast, the E-Rate Program has a lengthy history of service provider invoicing.  See, e.g., CTIA Comments 
at 14-15 (explaining that the provider-focused funding process used in E-Rate is rooted in a different statute with 
different purposes and should not be replicated for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program. “In E-Rate, the 
Commission historically provided funding to service providers in the first instance, but this is because of language in 
Section 254(h) that is not present in the American Rescue Plan Act.”).
265 See, e.g., CGCS Comments at 5 (stating that “submitting invoices for products and services that are ordered or 
received during the emergency period is sufficient documentation that state, local, or district procurements policies 
were followed to the extent possible”); ClientFirst Comments at 4 (asserting that the submission of invoices and 
documentation is a reasonable safeguard as it is similar to the documentation required in the E-Rate Program);  
(continued….)Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
48submit other supporting documentation at the time they submit their reimbursement requests, as discussed 
further below and pursuant to our document retention requirements, all participants must certify 
receipt/delivery of eligible equipment and services and that only eligible equipment and services were 
invoiced, as well as retain and provide upon request by USAC, Commission staff, or any other authorized 
federal entity with oversight authority over federal financial assistance and/or the federal response to the 
pandemic, all records related to their reimbursement request (including, for example, contracts and asset 
inventories).266  
97.Leveraging Existing E-Rate Invoicing Forms.  To further streamline the invoicing process 
and reduce burdens on applicants, we direct USAC to leverage the existing E-Rate invoicing forms to the 
extent feasible for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  Because we allow applicants and service 
providers to submit reimbursement requests, we expect USAC to use, to the extent possible, the FCC 
Form 472 (Billed Entity Applicant Reimbursement (BEAR) Form) and FCC Form 474 (Service Provider 
Invoice (SPI) Form) for this purpose.  As detailed below, we will require participants to make certain 
certifications on the form to protect against waste, fraud, and abuse.267  By leveraging existing E-Rate 
forms, we expect to save participants time needed to familiarize themselves with new forms and reduce 
administrative costs.
98.Invoicing Deadline.  The Public Notice sought comment on establishing a short window 
for schools and libraries to file invoices and reimbursement requests and sought comment on what the 
shortest possible invoice filing window would be that would not impose undue burden on applicants.268  
In order to allow the Commission to de-obligate committed funds for use by other schools and libraries, 
we direct USAC to start accepting requests for reimbursement within 15 days of the first wave of 
commitments in the first application filing window.  We permit applicants and service providers to submit 
reimbursement requests and invoices for prior and prospective purchases for 60 days from the date of the 
funding commitment decision letter; a revised funding commitment decision letter approving a post-
commitment change or a successful appeal of a previously denied or reduced funding commitment; or 
service delivery date, whichever is later.  That is half the time provided in the E-Rate Program, but 
necessary to ensure that we can identify unspent funds and make them available to other applicants as 
quickly as possible.  Commenters agree that a shorter invoicing period is reasonable and recommend an 
invoicing window of between 60 and 90 days.269  We find that 60 days strikes the correct balance. 
I. Payment Administration 
99. While USAC will be administering the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program as 
permitted under section 7402(c)(2)(A) of the American Rescue Plan, and pursuant to the terms of the 
Memorandum of Understanding between the Commission and USAC that authorizes the use of USAC for 
the administration of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program,270 the Commission must authorize the 
payments from the Emergency Connectivity Fund prior to the disbursement of those funds by the United

must be prepared to take to ensure timely payment of reimbursement claims from the Fund, as well as 
processes used to ensure proper payment.
100.FCC Red Light Rule.  To implement the requirements of the Debt Collection 
Improvement Act of 1996, the Commission established what is commonly referred to as the “red light 
rule.”272  Under the red light rule, the Commission will not take action on applications or other requests 
by an entity that is found to owe debts to the Commission until full payment or resolution of that debt.273  
If the delinquent debt remains unpaid or other arrangements have not been made within 30 days of being 
notified of the debt, the Commission will dismiss any pending applications.274  If an Emergency 
Connectivity Fund participant is currently on red light, it will need to satisfy or make arrangements to 
satisfy any debts that it owes to the Commission before its application can be processed.  
101.System for Award Management (SAM) Registration.  All applicants that intend to 
participate and all service providers that elect to submit requests for reimbursement in the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program must also register with the System for Award Management (SAM).  SAM is 
a web-based, government-wide application that collects, validates, stores, and disseminates business 
information about the federal government’s partners in support of federal awards, grants, and electronic 
payment processes.  Registration in the SAM provides the Commission with an authoritative source of 
information necessary to provide funding to applicants and to ensure accurate reporting pursuant to the 
Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, as amended by the Digital Accountability 
and Transparency Act of 2014 (collectively, Transparency Act or FFATA/DATA Act).275  Only those 
applicants and service providers that are actively registered in SAM will be able to receive reimbursement 
from the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  Applicants and service providers that are already 
registered with SAM do not need to re-register with that system in order to receive payment from the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  Applicants who are not already registered with SAM may still 
participate in the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, apply for funding, and receive program 
commitments.  However, active SAM registration is required for an applicant or service provider to 
receive a payment from the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.276  To assist participants who are not 
registered with SAM, we direct USAC to provide information and guidance to participants regarding the 
SAM registration process.  Furthermore, Program recipients may be subject to further FFATA/DATA Act 
reporting requirements to the extent that awardees subaward the payments they receive from the Program, 
as defined by FFATA/DATA Act regulations.  Recipients may be required to submit data on those

systems.  To register with the system, go to https://www.sam.gov/SAM/ and provide the requested information.Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58

102.Do Not Pay.  Pursuant to the requirements of the Payment Integrity Information Act of 
2019, the Commission is required to ensure that a thorough review of available databases with relevant 
information on eligibility occurs to determine program or award eligibility and prevent improper 
payments before the release of any federal funds.278  To meet this requirement, the Commission and 
USAC will make full use of the Do Not Pay system administered by the U.S. Treasury’s Bureau of the 
Fiscal Service.279  If a check of the Do Not Pay system results in a finding that an Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program applicant or service provider should not be paid, the Commission will not 
issue any funding commitments or issue disbursements.  The Emergency Connectivity Fund Program 
participant is responsible for working with the relevant agency to correct its information in the Do Not 
Pay system before its Emergency Connectivity Fund Program application is processed and Program 
payments can be issued.280
J. Designating USAC as the Administrator of the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program
103. Pursuant to the authority granted in section 7402(c)(2)(A) of the American Rescue Plan, 
and the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Commission and USAC that authorizes 
the use of USAC for the administration of the Emergency Connectivity Fund,281 we designate USAC as 
the Administrator of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  We will use USAC’s services to review 
and approve applications for funding, recommend funding commitments, issue funding commitment 
decision letters, review requests for reimbursement and invoices and recommend payment of funds, as 
well as other administration-related duties.  Commenters that addressed the issue overwhelmingly support 
using USAC and its processes for the efficient and effective administration of the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program,282 and we agree that USAC’s experience administering the E-Rate Program 
and other Commission pandemic response programs283 makes USAC uniquely situated to be the 
administrator of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.
104. In designating USAC as Administrator of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, we 
adopt the same requirements for USAC as are currently provided in section 54.702(c)-(d) of our rules

51governing USAC’s duties as Administrator of the Universal Service Support Programs.284  In so doing, 
among other things, we prohibit USAC from making policy, interpreting unclear statutes or rules relied 
upon to implement and administer the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, or interpreting the intent 
of Congress.285  
105. In its administration of the Program, we also direct USAC to comply with, on an ongoing 
basis, all applicable laws and federal government guidance on privacy and information security standards 
and requirements, such as the Privacy Act,286 relevant provisions in the Federal Information Security 
Modernization Act of 2014,287 National Institute of Standards and Technology publications, and Office of 
Management and Budget guidance.
106. Universal Service Fund Program audits have been successful in helping participants 
become compliant with the Commission’s rules and in protecting the funds from waste, fraud, and abuse.  
We therefore remind Emergency Connectivity Fund Program participants including schools, libraries, 
consortia, and service providers, that similar to the E-Rate and other Universal Service Fund Programs, 
they shall be subject to audits and other investigations to evaluate their compliance with the statutory and 
regulatory requirements for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  If the Commission determines 
that USAC should administer program audits for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, the 
Commission will direct USAC to perform such audits pursuant to the Commission and USAC’s 
respective roles and responsibilities in the Memorandum of Understanding.288
107. We also provide a path for recourse to parties aggrieved by decisions issued by USAC.  
Specifically, we adopt the appeals and waiver request rules that govern USAC’s administration of the 
Universal Service Support Programs, including the E-Rate Program.289  We find these existing processes 
sufficient to provide a meaningful review of decisions issued by USAC and the Commission regarding 
the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  However, we make one modification for the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program appeal and waiver rules and provide a 30-day timeframe to request the 
review of an action by USAC,290 or to request the review of a decision by USAC or a waiver of the 
Commission’s rules.291  We make this change because this is a short-term emergency program and to help 
provide faster timeframes for issuing appeal and waiver decisions.
K. Children’s Internet Protection Act 
108. We find that the obligations of the Children’s Internet Protection Act (CIPA), which 
apply to schools and libraries having computers with Internet access that seek E-Rate funding for Internet 
access, Internet service, or internal connections under section 254(h)(1)(b) of the Communications Act 
also apply to schools and libraries making certain purchases through the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program.  Specifically, we conclude that CIPA applies to the use of school or library owned computers, 
including laptop and tablet computers, if the school or library accepts Emergency Connectivity Fund or E-

Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (Pub. L. No. 113-283, Dec. 18, 2014).  As modified, FISMA is

52Rate support for Internet access or Internet services, or E-Rate support for internal connections.  We also 
conclude that CIPA does not apply where schools or libraries have purchased advanced 
telecommunications and information services through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program to be 
used only in conjunction with student-, school staff- or patron-owned computers.  As explained below, 
these conclusions reflect the fact that section 7402(a) of the American Rescue Plan expressly provides 
that Emergency Connectivity Fund support is to be made available pursuant to section 254(h)(1)(B) and 
(2) of the Communications Act.292  
109. Congress enacted CIPA as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, 
amending section 254 of the Communications Act.293  CIPA requires a school or library “having” 
Internet-connected computers and receiving E-Rate funding for Internet access, Internet service, or 
internal connections to comply with, and certify its compliance with, specific Internet safety requirements 
for “its” computers, including the adoption and enforcement of an Internet Safety Policy that includes the 
operation of a technology protection measure.294  Schools, but not libraries, must also provide education 
about appropriate online behavior including cyberbullying.295  
110. Many commenters support the applicability of CIPA requirements in the context of the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program,296 while others raised concerns regarding the potential 
challenges of implementing CIPA compliance on services and devices that are outside of the applicant’s 
direct control.297  We reject the argument made by at least two commenters that CIPA does not apply to 
the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program because the American Rescue Plan does not explicitly cite to 
292 H.R. 1319, tit. VII, § 7402(a); see also 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(1)(B), (h)(2).
293 Pub. L. No. 106-554.  CIPA is codified at section 254(h)(5)-(6), and (l) of the Communications Act of 1934, as 
amended.  See 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(5)-(6) and (l).  CIPA requires each covered school and library to certify that the 
school or library is: (1) enforcing a policy of Internet safety that includes the operation of a technology protection 
measure with respect to any of its computers with Internet access that protects against access [by both adults and 
minors] through such computers to visual depictions that are, (i) obscene; (ii) child pornography; or, (iii) with 
respect to use of the computers by minors, harmful to minors; and (2) enforcing the operation of such technology 
protection measure during any use of such computers by minors and adults. 47 U.S.C. §§ 254(h)(5)(B)(i),(ii) and 
(C)(i),(ii), (6)(B)(i)-(ii) and (C)(i)-(ii) and 254(l); 47 CFR § 54.520(c)(1)(i) and (c)(2)(i); see also 2001 CIPA Order;

(1)(B)” except for services other than the provision of Internet access, Internet service, or internal connections.  Id. 
§§ 254(h)(5)(A)(i)-(ii), (h)(6)(A)(i)-(ii).  The Commission has consistently interpreted these provisions to mean that 
CIPA “only applies to entities receiving Internet access, Internet service, or internal connections” and excludes 
schools and libraries receiving only telecommunications services.  See, e.g., 2001 CIPA Order, 16 FCC Rcd at 8195-

campus use lack the functionality to implement filtering).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
53the CIPA provisions in section 254 of the Communications Act.298  Section 7402(a) of the American 
Rescue Plan requires that the Emergency Connectivity Fund is to be made available under section 
254(h)(1)(B) and (2),299 and CIPA requirements apply to eligible entities having computers with Internet 
access that seek funding for Internet access, and Internet service, and internal connections under the same 
provision, section 254(h)(1)(B).300  Therefore, as discussed further in this section, we conclude that CIPA 
requirements extend to eligible entities having computers with Internet access that seek support for 
Internet access or Internet service through the Emergency Connectivity Fund pursuant to section 
254(h)(1)(B).  Few commenters, however, analyzed whether CIPA’s applicability might depend on which 
equipment and services a school or library purchases through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  
And we conclude that such an analysis is necessary, given the unique text and structure of CIPA.
111.First, we conclude that CIPA applies to the use of any computers owned by a school or 
library, including those purchased with Emergency Connectivity Fund support if the school or library 
receives Emergency Connectivity Fund or E-Rate support for Internet access or Internet services, or E-
Rate support for internal connections.  This is true even if the student or library patron does not use 
Internet access services provided by the school or library.301  This conclusion follows from the statutory 
text:  CIPA applies to a school or library “having” computers and requires the entity to certify compliance 
as to “its” computers.302  Both words indicate that CIPA is triggered by ownership of a device, not the 
location where the device is used or temporarily possessed.  We disagree with the suggestion that CIPA 
applicability is narrowly limited to school- or library-owned computers within a school or library 
building.303  While the drafters of CIPA may have been primarily focused on computers within schools or 
libraries, that is because of the circumstances at the time,304 and the plain language of the statute is not so 
limited.  It reaches the use of devices owned by schools and libraries, regardless of whether the device is 
used off-campus, including use of such devices by students in their homes.
112.Second, we conclude that CIPA does not apply to the use of computers owned by a 
school or library including those laptop computers or tablet computers purchased with support from the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, if the purchasing entity does not also receive Emergency 
Connectivity Fund or E-Rate discounted Internet access or Internet services, or E-Rate discounted internal 
connections—or network equipment for Internet access, Internet service, or internal connections.  Here 
too, our conclusion follows from the plain text of the statute.  CIPA prohibits a school or library from

Reply at 2 (COSLA Reply).
299 See H.R. 1319, tit. VII, § 7402(a); see also 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(1)(B), (h)(2).
300 See 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(5)(A)(i)-(ii) and (h)(6)(A)(i)-(ii). 
301 We clarify that Internet access, Internet service, or internal connections include modems, routers, and hotspots, 
which qualify as eligible “Network Equipment” for Internet access, Internet service, or internal connections.
302 47 U.S.C. §§ 254(h)(5)(A)(i), (B)(i) and (h)(6)(A)(i), (B)(i); see also SECA April 23 Ex Parte at 5 (arguing the 
word “its” in the statute refers to the schools’ computer, which demonstrates the intent to require CIPA compliance 
on school-owned computers, whether on-campus or off-campus).  
303 See, e.g., ALA Comments at 12 (arguing that the statutory reference to “a library” demonstrates intent to limit 
applicability to inside a library building); Milwaukee Public Library Comments at 5 (contending that CIPA was 
intended to protect children inside of schools and libraries); Altice Comments at 10 (asserting that CIPA does not 
apply outside of a school or library building); COSLA Reply at 2 (understanding that the language in CIPA applies 
to use inside of library buildings); Urban Libraries Council Reply at 4; Massachusetts Board of Library 
Commissioners Reply at 4.
304 See Modernizing the E-Rate Program for Schools and Libraries, WC Docket No. 13-184, Notice of Proposed 
Rulemaking, 28 FCC Rcd 11304, 11378, para. 272 (2013) (“When CIPA was enacted, most school and library 
computers that provided Internet access were found at large, stationary terminals.”).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
54“receiv[ing] services at discount rates” unless it complies with CIPA.305  CIPA also makes clear that this 
prohibition does not apply to a school or library that receives discounted services “only for purposes other 
than the provision of Internet access, Internet service, or internal connections.”306  The Commission has 
construed these provisions to mean that CIPA “applies [only] to entities receiving Internet access, Internet 
service, or internal connections” under section 254(h).307  Thus, there is no statutory basis for requiring 
CIPA compliance from a school or library that does not receive those services through E-Rate or the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund—even if it purchases laptop computers or tablet computers through the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund.
113.Third and finally, we conclude that CIPA does not apply to the use of third-party owned 
devices, even if the school or library receives Emergency Connectivity Fund or E-Rate support for 
Internet access or Internet services, or E-Rate support for internal connections.  This interpretation flows 
from the statute.  A school or library does not “hav[e]” student-, school staff- or patron-owned devices, 
nor would it make sense for a school or library to certify that those devices are “its” devices for purposes 
of CIPA compliance.308  Moreover, when read in conjunction with section 254(h)(5) and (6), section 
254(l) is meant to apply only to a school’s or library’s computers—and not to the delivery of services for 
a student’s, school staff’s or library patron’s personal computer.  Schools and libraries are free to decide 
whether to allow the use of third-party devices on their own networks or the broadband connections 
purchased for use by their students, school staff, and library patrons and to adopt measures to protect or 
limit the use of those connections by students, school staff or library patrons using their own devices to 
access those connections.  
114.CIPA Certifications.  In recognition of the long history of CIPA compliance in the E-Rate 
application process,309 we find that an Emergency Connectivity Fund applicant need not complete 
additional CIPA compliance certifications if it has already certified its CIPA compliance for E-Rate 
support for the relevant funding year (i.e., has certified its compliance in an FCC Form 486 or FCC Form 
479).310  To the extent an applicant for Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support has not already 
certified its CIPA compliance for E-Rate applications, these applicants will be required to certify either 
(1) that it is in compliance with CIPA requirements under section 254(h) and (l); (2) that it is undertaking 
the actions necessary to comply with CIPA requirements;311 or (3) if applicable, that the requirements of 
CIPA do not apply, because the applicant is not receiving discounted Internet access, Internet services, or 
internal connections.  We conclude that our approach will best ensure full accountability and compliance 
305 47 U.S.C. §§ 254(h)(5)(A)(i), (6)(A)(i).  
306 47 U.S.C. §§ 254(h)(5)(A)(ii), (6)(A)(ii).  
307 2001 CIPA Order, 16 FCC Rcd at 8195-96, para. 28 (quotation marks omitted).
308 47 U.S.C. §§ 254(h)(5)(A)(i), (B)(i) and (h)(6)(A)(i), (B)(i).
309 In the E-Rate Program, applicants are required to certify compliance with the CIPA requirements set out in 
section 254(h) and (l) on the Receipt of Service Confirmation Form (FCC Form 486), or the Certification by 
Administrative Authority to Billed Entity of Compliance with the Children’s Internet Protection Act (FCC Form 
479).  See 47 U.S.C. § 254(h) and (l); 47 CFR § 54.520 (providing the Commission’s requirements for compliance 
with CIPA).
310 See 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(5)(A)(i), (6)(A)(i) (requiring certifications concerning section 254(h)(5), (h)(6), and (l)). 
If an applicant’s existing certification states that CIPA does not apply because the applicant is receiving only 
telecommunications services, and if the applicant’s Emergency Connectivity Fund purchases trigger CIPA 
compliance requirements, the applicant will be required to provide new certifications via the FCC Form 471. 
311 We find that requiring applicants to certify that they are undertaking such actions necessary to comply with CIPA 
is consistent with CIPA and will not impose an undue burden on new applicants and is in the interest of getting the 
funding out expeditiously.  See 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(5)(E)(ii)(II)(aa), (6)(E)(ii)(II)(aa) (requiring schools and libraries 
without Internet safety policy and technology protection measures in place to certify to “undertaking such actions” 
to put the requirements into place).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
55on the part of all schools and libraries, while minimizing administrative burdens and costs for applicants 
and the Commission.  To streamline the application and reimbursement process, the CIPA certifications 
will be included on the FCC Form 471 that will be used for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program 
and will not be on a separate FCC form.
L. Protections Against Waste, Fraud, and Abuse 
115. We take seriously our obligation to be a careful steward of the Emergency Connectivity 
Fund, and to protect the Program from waste, fraud, and abuse.  We are committed to ensuring the 
integrity of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program and will pursue instances of waste, fraud, or 
abuse under our own procedures and in cooperation with law enforcement agencies.  The specific 
procedures identified below regarding asset inventory requirements, document retention requirements, the 
prohibition on gifts, certifications, audits, and treatment of eligible equipment are tools at our disposal to 
protect the Emergency Connectivity Fund and to ensure the limited funding is used for its intended 
purposes to support and enable remote learning for students, school staff, and library patrons nationwide.
1. Device and Service Inventory Requirements
116. We require Emergency Connectivity Fund Program participants to maintain inventories 
of devices and services purchased with Program support.312  Commenters are very supportive of requiring 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program participants to maintain device and service inventories, which are 
also required in the E-Rate Program.313  Requiring eligible entities to keep and maintain inventories for 
eligible equipment and services purchased through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program ensures 
that schools and libraries know where the Emergency Connectivity Fund-supported equipment and 
services are located and that they are being used consistent with the same requirement in the E-Rate 
Program.314  We are sympathetic to concerns expressed by some commenters that keeping track of 
equipment in the homes of students and library patrons is more difficult than maintaining an inventory list 
of equipment in a school or library.  We acknowledge the fact that some loss of equipment as a result of 
students, school staff, or library patrons breaking or losing the equipment or moving out of the area and 
not returning it, and other similar scenarios is to be expected and is not per se evidence of waste, fraud 
and abuse by the applicants.315  However, it is the obligation of schools and libraries to keep track of and 
document the devices and other equipment that they distribute, and that includes documenting 
information about missing, lost, or damaged equipment.  
117. For the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, the asset inventory for devices provided 
to individuals, must include the following information:  (a) device type (i.e., laptop, tablet, mobile 
hotspot, modem/router); (b) device make/model; (c) equipment serial number; (d) the name of the person 
to whom the device was provided; and (e) the dates the device was loaned out and returned to the school 
312 See Public Notice at 16.
313 See, e.g., M-DCPS Comments at 5 (noting the district will continue to apply the E-Rate rules for retaining and 
presenting records and maintaining asset and service inventories); Bethlehem Area School District Comments at 5 
(agreeing that an inventory of services and devices funded through the Emergency Connectivity Fund should be 
retained); SECA Comments at 16 (“[A]pplicants should be required to maintain records of their purchases and other 
documentation consistent with the traditional E-rate program.… Asset inventories already must be maintained for 
equipment purchased with E-rate funds”); EducationSuperHighway Comments at 8 (supporting the requirement that 
asset and service inventories are retained); see also Alaska DEED Comments at 5-6 (explaining that asset 
inventories should be retained with the location, make, model, serial number, but without the individual person’s 
name and address because of privacy concerns).

devices that often move, break, or go missing at a higher rate in the hands of students and library patrons).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
56or library.316  The inventory for devices not provided to individual students, school staff, or library 
patrons, but used to provide service to multiple eligible users, for example, a Wi-Fi hotspot used to 
provide service on a school bus, must include the following information:  (a) device type (i.e., laptop, 
tablet, mobile hotspot, modem/router); (b) device make/model; (c) equipment serial number; (d) the name 
of the school or library employee responsible for that device; and (e) the dates the device was in 
service.317  
118. We further require Emergency Connectivity Fund Program participants to maintain a 
record of services purchased with Emergency Connectivity Fund support.318  This record of services must 
include the following information:  (a) type of service provided (i.e., DSL, cable, fiber, fixed wireless, 
satellite, mobile wireless); (b) broadband plan details, including: upload and download speeds and 
monthly data cap; (c) the name(s) of the person(s) to whom the service was provided; and for fixed 
broadband service; (d) the service address, and (e) the installation date of service: and (f) the last date of 
service (as applicable).319  The inventory for service not provided to an individual student, school staff 
member, or library patron, but used to provide service to multiple eligible users must include the 
following information: (a) type of service provided (i.e., DSL, cable, fiber, fixed wireless, satellite, 
mobile wireless); (b) broadband plan details, including: upload and download speeds and monthly data 
cap; and (c) the name of the school or library employee responsible for the service; (d) a description of 
the intended service area; and for fixed broadband service; (e) the service address; (f) the installation date 
of service, and (g) the last date of service (as applicable).320  
2. Document Retention Requirements
119. We also adopt records retention rules for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.321  
Specifically, we require Emergency Connectivity Fund Program participants to retain records related to 
their participation in the Program sufficient to demonstrate compliance with all Program rules for at least 
10 years from the last date of service or delivery of equipment.322  This 10-year document retention 
requirement is consistent with the document retention requirement in the E-Rate Program, and many 
commenters were supportive of conforming the document retention requirements of the two programs.323  
Doing so allows E-Rate participants to rely on their existing retention polices and mitigates the confusion 
that different retention periods might create.  Some commenters supported a shorter document retention 
period, explaining that the emergency nature of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program makes the 10-
year document retention period too long.324  We find some of the shorter suggested document retention 
316 See 47 CFR § 54.1715(a)(1).
317 See 47 CFR § 54.1715(a)(2).
318 See Public Notice at 16.
319 See 47 CFR § 54.1715(a)(3).
320 See 47 CFR § 54.1715(a)(4).
321 See 47 CFR § 54.1715(b).
322 47 CFR § 54.1715(b).
323 See, e.g., E-mpa Comments at 5 (agreeing that existing E-Rate document retention requirements should apply to 
the Emergency Connectivity Fund); AT&T Comments at 7; CETF Comments at 21.  Our commitment to protect the 
privacy of students, school staff, and library patrons should alleviate the concerns expressed by Buffalo & Erie 
County Public Library that records retention requirements regarding use of certain devices could be an invasion of 
the privacy of library patrons.  Our rules cannot and should not be interpreted to require schools or libraries to 
collect, maintain, or produce to Commission staff or USAC information regarding the browsing history or 
application usage of students, school staff or library patrons.
324 See, e.g., NCTA Comments at 9 (recommending that a six-year document retention period be used consistent 
with the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program); Los Angeles Unified School District Comments, Attach. at 3 
(arguing that “the three-year documentation retention and audit period as prescribed for the COVID-19 Telehealth 
(continued….)Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
57periods of only one or two years inadequate to protect the integrity of the Fund – as they would not 
provide sufficient time to uncover and investigate instances of waste, fraud, and abuse.  Although the 
Commission has adopted shorter document retention periods for both the Emergency Broadband Benefit 
Program325 and the COVID-19 Telehealth Program,326 we note that Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program support may be available through September 30, 2030 and given the size of the fund, $7.17 
billion, a longer document retention period is reasonable for this Program.  On balance, we find that a 10-
year period is appropriate for the Emergency Connectivity Program, because it allows the Commission 
the ability to protect the integrity of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program and is consistent with the 
document retention requirements for the E-Rate Program.  Participants are further required to present this 
information upon request to the Commission or its delegates, including USAC, as well as to the 
Commission’s Office of Inspector General.327
3. Gift Rule
120. In balancing the longstanding goal of fair and open procurement of eligible equipment 
and services, with the efforts made to date by schools and libraries and service providers to meet remote 
learning needs during the pandemic, we agree with commenters that gift restrictions should apply to the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.328  As AT&T explains, not applying the gift rule “could 
compromise fair and open procurement.”329  We recognize that many schools and libraries may have 
taken advantage of free or discounted connections and devices offered by service providers over the 
course of the pandemic as a result of the waiver of the E-Rate gift rule granted by the Bureau last year.330  
That waiver currently enables service providers to offer and provide, and schools and libraries to solicit 
and accept improved broadband connections or equipment for remote learning through June 30, 2021.  
Moreover, it is impractical to try to impose restrictions on activity that occurred before Congress 
established the Emergency Connectivity Fund.331  
121. Therefore, we adopt gift restrictions for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program that 
take into account that waiver.  The gift restrictions we adopt for the Program prohibit eligible schools and 
libraries receiving support through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, including their 
employees, officers, representatives, agents, independent contractors, and individuals who are on the 
governing boards, from soliciting or accepting any gift or other thing of value from a service provider 
participating in or seeking to participate in the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  Participating

effectively punish schools for accepting critical connectivity support when they needed it most”).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
58service providers are likewise prohibited from offering or providing any gift or other thing of value to 
eligible entities, including their employees, officers, representatives, agents, independent contractors, and 
individuals who are on the governing boards.332  
122. In light of the extraordinary needs of schools and libraries to meet the remote learning 
needs of students, school staff, and library patrons during the pandemic, and the existing partial waiver of 
the gift rule in the E-Rate program, we provide an exception in the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program gift rule that allows service providers to offer and provide, and applicants to solicit and accept, 
broadband connections, devices, networking equipment, or other things of value that are directly related 
to addressing the pandemic-related needs of students, school staff, and library patrons through June 30, 
2022.333  We provide this limited exception for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program through the 
end of June 2022 with the hope that by the end of this coming school year, the pandemic-related needs of 
schools and libraries for broadband connections, devices and networking equipment will have, for the 
most part, been met.  Should that not be the case, affected parties will be able to seek a waiver of the gift 
rules, following the sunset of this exception.  We find that this approach protects the integrity of the 
procurement of purchases through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program without unnecessarily 
burdening applicants or hindering beneficial partnerships between participating service providers, 
schools, and libraries that support remote learning efforts during these unprecedented times.   
4. Certifications
123. As an additional measure to safeguard the Emergency Connectivity Fund from waste, 
fraud, and abuse, we require participants to provide several certifications as part of the application and 
invoicing processes.  We have found, and participants largely agree, that the use of certifications are a key 
compliance mechanism to protect the limited funds from waste, fraud, and abuse.334  All certifications 
must be made subject to the provisions against false statements contained in the Communications Act335 
and Title 18 of the United States Code.336  
124.Compliance with Local, State, and Tribal Procurement Requirements Certification.  To 
streamline and promote an efficient application process without adopting competitive bidding 
requirements for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, applicants will be required to certify as part 
of the FCC Form 471 that they have complied with all applicable local, state, and Tribal procurement 
requirements for any equipment and services purchased, or that will be purchased, with Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program support.337  Schools and libraries that are not subject to public procurement 
requirements must certify that that have complied with their own procurement processes and 
requirements, such as those included in a written charter.  Complying with local, state, and Tribal 
procurement rules is an important safeguard to ensure that costs for eligible equipment and services are 
reasonable and cost-effective.  If applicants are unable or unwilling to certify that they have complied 
with local, state, or Tribal procurement requirements, they will not receive support from the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program.338  We recognize this may cause hardship for certain schools and libraries, 
but given the importance of protecting the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, we must ensure

with state, Tribal or local procurement requirements).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
59applicants are compliant with local, state, or Tribal procurement requirements to receive commitments 
and reimbursements through the Program.
125.Duplicate Funding Certification.  To avoid duplicative funding, protect against waste, 
fraud, and abuse, and to stretch the limited support available through the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program, we will not provide support from the Fund for eligible equipment and services that have already 
been reimbursed through other federal pandemic relief programs (e.g., CARES Act, Emergency 
Broadband Benefit Program, or other provisions of the American Rescue Plan); state programs 
specifically targeted to providing funding for eligible equipment and services; other external sources of 
funding or gifts specifically targeted to providing funding for eligible equipment and services.339  For 
example, if a student’s household is receiving support from the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program 
for broadband Internet access connectivity, the student would not be eligible for broadband connectivity 
under the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.340  Commenters are supportive of adopting this 
limitation to stretch the limited funds.341
126. However, we also agree with commenters that argue schools and libraries should be able 
to request reimbursement for a portion of the costs of eligible equipment and services if they received 
funding from another source for only a portion of the costs of that equipment or services.342  For example, 
the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) explains that it established the California Teleconnect 
Fund Distance Learning Discount in March 2020 to provide a 50% discount on monthly recurring charges 
for mobile data services (hotspots) to qualifying K-12 schools, libraries, and other community-based 
organizations.  We agree that the schools and libraries that received 50% discounts through this Program 
should still be able to seek reimbursement through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program for the 
portion of the costs that were not covered by the CPUC’s program.343  We therefore make clear that 
schools and libraries may request and receive reimbursement for the portion of the costs of eligible 
equipment and services that were not covered through other sources of funding.  
127. We agree, to an extent, with commenters that argue that if applicants were able to pay for 
eligible equipment and services through a financial gift or donation, that they should be allowed to also 
seek reimbursement through the Emergency Connectivity Fund in some situations.  If the donor specified 
that the gift was to be used for the type of equipment or services at issue, the applicant cannot seek to use 
the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program as a second source of funding for the same equipment or 
service.  But, if the school or library simply used general funds it had available to it as the result of gifts 
or donations, it can seek reimbursement of the cost of the equipment or services from the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program.344
339 See Public Notice at 15. 
340 A student whose household is receiving broadband service through the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program, 
however, could receive a connected device through the Emergency Connectivity Fund if she would otherwise lack 
such access.
341 See, e.g., T-Mobile Comments at 17 (agreeing with this limitation and expressing concerns that without it, 
schools and libraries could be pressured into applying for Emergency Connectivity Fund support in order to return 
spent funds); USTelecom Comments at 8-9 (supporting this limitation and requiring applicants to certify that they 
are not requesting duplicate funding); CTIA Comments at 17 (agreeing that the Commission should limit 
reimbursements to eligible equipment and services that are not funded through other programs); WISPA Comments 
at 6 (agreeing that schools and libraries should be reimbursed if funding was received through other programs to 
avoid duplicate funding).
342 See, e.g., CPUC Comments at 6-7.  
343 Id.
344 See NCTA Comments at 6 (“To the extent the school does pay for eligible services or equipment, it should be 
reimbursed through ECF, even if the payment was made possible by a financial gift or donation.”).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
60128. To implement this prohibition on requesting or receiving duplicative funding, we will 
require applicants to certify, on the application for funding and on the invoicing form that they are not 
seeking Emergency Connectivity Fund support or reimbursement for eligible equipment or services that 
have been purchased and reimbursed with other federal pandemic-relief funding (e.g., CARES Act, 
Emergency Broadband Benefit Program, Emergency Connectivity Fund Program); targeted state funding; 
other external sources of targeted funding or targeted gifts; or eligible for discounts through the schools 
and libraries universal service support mechanism or other universal service support mechanisms.345  We 
take this action to ensure that the limited Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support will be used for 
its intended purposes and if the eligible equipment and services were reimbursed through other federal 
funds or other sources targeted for those purposes, the applicants should not be seeking funding through 
the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.
129.Non-Usage Certification.  In order to ensure that the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program makes the best use of limited funding, the Public Notice sought comment on whether service 
providers providing monthly services reimbursed through the Emergency Connectivity Fund should be 
required to report and validate usage of the supported services.346  The Public Notice also sought comment 
on whether, if there is non-usage during a service month, service providers should be required to notify 
the school or library regarding the non-usage, and to remove the cost for any non-used service from the 
invoice provided to the school or library for that service month.347  The Public Notice further sought 
comment on whether service providers should also be required to certify that they have notified the school 
or library regarding any non-usage during a service month and have removed charges from such non-
usage from the invoices submitted to the school or library for payment.348  There was widespread 
agreement that such actions to address non-usage would be overly burdensome on both the service 
providers349 and the applicants.350  
130. Based on the record before us, we find that the better course will be to have applicants 
certify on requests for reimbursement (i.e., the invoicing form) that the equipment and services are being 
primarily used for educational purposes by students, school staff, or library patrons and both applicants

349 See, e.g., CETF Comments at 21 (agreeing that there should be some oversight, but not to the degree that it is 
insensitive to school schedules or imposes a digital literacy training as a requirement that would take time to 
schedule); South Carolina Comments at 12 (explaining that requiring service providers to notify the school of library 
on non-usage every month is overly burdensome); City of San Jose Comments at 4-5 (explaining that requiring 
monthly reporting and use and reviewing detailed invoices for large inventories of over 15,800 devices will cause an 
undue burden on staff); T-Mobile Comments at 22 (requiring service providers to submit documentation about non-
usage will impose a monthly recurring obligation on applicant). 
350 See, e.g., WTA Comments at 4-5 (arguing that “requiring service providers to monitor, report, and adjust pricing 
for non-usage constitutes a major complication and disincentive [to offer bulk purchasing pricing]”); Verizon 
Comments at 11 (explaining that requiring “service providers to ‘report and validate usage of the supported service’ 
and ‘remove the cost of any non-used service from the invoice’ would be overly burdensome for service providers to 
implement”); CTIA Comments at 19 (asserting that not all providers will have the ability to identify non-usage and 
those that are able to, may not be able to do so in real time and the costs for implementing this administrative 
requirement will outweigh any benefit for this rule).  We decline to adopt Verizon’s suggestion that we allow a 
period of non-usage up to three months.  See Verizon Ex Parte at 3.  We require parties to take reasonable steps to 
track non-usage but without adding specific timeframes that must be accounted for applicants to determine whether 
there was non-usage.  Although Verizon used summertime in its example, the three-month period could occur any 
time during the school year. Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
61and service providers are not willfully or knowingly requesting reimbursement for equipment or services 
that are not being used.  Participants should take reasonable actions to monitor and track the usage of 
equipment and services that are purchased and reimbursed through the Emergency Connectivity Fund, for 
example, requiring their service providers to provide monthly reports or other information on data use.351  
We adopt these measures to ensure that the equipment and services purchased through the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program are being used for educational purposes and to prevent wasteful spending for 
unused services, and determine the certification requirement strikes a fair balance between the burdens on 
applicants and service providers to monitor non-usage and the need to protect the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program from wasteful non-usage.
131.Additional Certification Requirements.  We also require participants when submitting 
requests for reimbursement (i.e., invoicing forms) to provide several additional certifications.352  
Participants will also certify that they are seeking funding only for eligible equipment and services.  In 
addition, consistent with the asset and service inventories and records retention requirements discussed 
above, participants will be required to certify that they maintain an asset inventory, an inventory of 
services provided, and data regarding fixed broadband services.  Participants will also be required to 
certify that they will retain all program records for 10 years following the last date of service, as well as to 
their agreement to participate in audits and other post-commitment reviews as may be required.
5. Audits 
132. As we have for all the Universal Service Fund Programs, we consider audits in the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program to be an important tool in ensuring compliance, and identifying 
instances of waste, fraud, and abuse.353  Every dollar lost to waste, fraud, and abuse is funding that does 
not go to provide devices or connectivity to students, school staff, or library patrons.  Not surprisingly, 
commenters are largely supportive of establishing audit procedures for the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program.354  To that end, we delegate authority to the Office of the Managing Director to develop and 
implement an audit process for participants that complies with the requirements and procedures of the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  The Office of the Managing Director may obtain the assistance 
of third parties, including but not limited to USAC, in carrying out this effort.  
133. In developing audit requirements, the Office of the Managing Director should be mindful 
of the emergency nature of the pandemic and the intended use for eligible equipment and services 
purchased with Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support.355  Specifically, Emergency Connectivity 
Fund participants shall be subject to audits and other investigations to evaluate compliance with the 
statutory and regulatory requirements for the Emergency Connectivity Fund, including what equipment 
and services may be purchased using support from the Emergency Connectivity Fund, and how the 
351 See. e.g., ALA Comments at 13 (stating that there is merit in requiring service providers to provide information 
to applicants on usage of services supported though the Program, but opposing removing the cost for the service or 
device from the invoice provided to the applicant); Bethlehem Area School District Comments at 5 (agreeing that it 
is acceptable to have service providers provide monthly reports and valid usage of the supported services); M-DCPS 
Comments at 5 (same).  See also T-Mobile Comments at 22 (offering that if this requirement was adopted, service 
providers be able to provide the data on a quarterly basis instead of a monthly basis to ease the burden on 
applicants).  See also 47 CFR § 54.1711(e)(8).
352 See, e.g., 47 CFR §§ 54.1710(a)(1)(i)-(xii), 54.1711(e)(1)-(12).

USTelecom Comments at 13; WISPA Comments at 9-10; U.S. Cellular Comments at 4.
355 Some commenters, owing to the emergency nature of this program, argue for a “gentle hand” during audits and 
other enforcement.  See E-mpa Comments at 4.  E-Rate Management Professionals Association asks that we not 
penalize schools during an audit for equipment that is lost or breaks during the first three years of use, given that 
students may lose or break connected devices used at home.  E-mpa Comments at 8, 10-11.Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
62equipment and services may be used.356  Funding recipients are required to maintain documentation 
sufficient to demonstrate their compliance with program rules for ten years after the last date of delivery 
of services or connected devices supported through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.357  Upon 
request, Emergency Connectivity Fund Program participants must submit documents sufficient to 
demonstrate compliance with Program rules.358  Additionally, schools and libraries participating in the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, may be subject to other audit processes including audits by the 
Office of Inspector General, and certain schools and libraries participating in the Emergency Connectivity 
Fund Program that meet the thresholds for being audited under the Single Audit Act are subject to a 
single audit that contains the FCC compliance supplement for the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program.359 
134. We are also mindful of the privacy concerns raised regarding providing personally 
identifiable information to USAC or  Commission staff about the individual (e.g., student, school staff 
member, or library patron) that is receiving and using the Emergency Connectivity Fund-supported 
equipment and/or services.360  USAC and Commission staff will abide by all applicable federal and state 
privacy laws.  We also direct USAC and Commission staff to take into account the importance of 
protecting the privacy of students, school staff and library patrons, to design requests for information 
from schools and libraries that minimize the need to produce information that might reveal personally 
identifiable information, and to work with auditors to accept anonymized or deidentified information in 
response to requests for information wherever possible.361  If anonymized or deidentified information 
regarding the students, school staff, and library patrons is not sufficient for auditors’ or investigative 
purposes, the auditors or investigators may request that the school or library obtain consent of the parents 
or guardians, for students, and the consent of the school staff member or library patron to have access to 
this personally identifiable information or explore other legal options for obtaining personally identifiable 
information.362  In the event consent is not available, we recognize that the auditors may need to use other

reprinted in 2 CFR Part 200 (2020).  Federal award recipients that expend $750,000 or more in federal awards in a 
fiscal year are required to undergo a single audit, which is an audit of an entity’s financial statements and federal 
awards, or a program-specific audit, for the fiscal year.  31 U.S.C. § 7502; 31 CFR § 200.501 (2020).
360 See, e.g., CDT Comments at 9-12 (arguing that only aggregated student data should be used for funding decisions 
and audits because of legal protections for personally identifiable information of students and concerns that 
individual-level student data may not be reliable); ALA Comments at 2-3, 7 (opposing the adoption of any metric 
that requires libraries to collect patron use and explaining that various state privacy laws protect against such 
disclosures); NNTRC Comments at 8 (expressing concern that some parents may not feel comfortable with having 
their students participate in a program where personal information is being collected); SHLB Comments at 6 (stating 
that requiring schools and libraries to record which individuals used any Emergency Connectivity Fund supported 
services or equipment and make that information available to the Commission or USAC violates student and patron 
privacy laws).
361 See, e.g., E-mpa Comments at 11 (recommending that audit procedures for the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
focus on invoicing, payments, and delivery of supported equipment and services); The City of Chicago, Chicago 
Public Library and Chicago Public Schools Remote Learning Comments, WC Docket No. 21-31, at 9-10 
(acknowledging that audits are a useful tool but requesting that the Commission consider differences in audits of off-
site devices and services).
362 Several commenters are supportive of using deanonymized or deidentified information for use in audits.  See, 
e.g., ALA Comments at 3 (“We recommend circulation data and data use statistics, with redacted personally 
identifiable information, would indicate the reach and demand for services provided through libraries.”); City of San 
Jose Comments at 2 (suggesting libraries could provide de-identified and aggregated data from voluntary library 
patron surveys that collects data on the use and need for the Wi-Fi hotspot devices supported through the Emergency

63procedures or take different actions to determine if there is any evidence of waste, fraud or abuse in the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.
6. Treatment of Eligible Equipment during and after the COVID-19 
Emergency Period 
135. In order to protect against waste, fraud, and abuse in the Emergency Connectivity Fund 
Program, and consistent with the current E-Rate rules, we prohibit schools and libraries from selling, 
reselling, or transferring equipment funded through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program in 
consideration of money for three (3) years after its purchase.363  We conclude that eligible equipment 
purchased with Emergency Connectivity Fund Program support that has been in use for at least three 
years will be considered obsolete.364  Obsolete equipment may be resold or transferred in consideration of 
money or any other thing of value, disposed of, donated, or traded.  This approach is consistent with  
section 254(h)(3) of the Communications Act, which applies to the E-Rate Program, and the existing E-
Rate Program rules, which prohibit sale, resale or transfer of E-Rate-supported equipment for five 
years.365  We adopt this shorter three-year time frame for the Emergency Connectivity Fund, because we 
agree with commenters that devices and other equipment loaned to students, school staff, and library 
patrons and installed off-campus will likely have a shorter average life cycle than equipment installed and 
maintained on school or library premises.366
136. We consider but reject suggestions that we “should not prohibit the sale, resale, or 
transfer of the purchased equipment for anything of value despite the current E-Rate Program rules so 
long as any such proceed or value be employed for educational or library purposes.”367  Congress has 
authorized the use of billions of dollars for purchase of specific types of equipment, and we think 
permitting schools and libraries to trade in that equipment to fund other programs or services would be 
inconsistent with Congress’ intent.
137. We hope and expect that the useful life of much of the eligible equipment purchased 
through the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program will extend beyond the COVID-19 emergency 
period, and that schools and libraries can continue to use the equipment as the pandemic recedes.  At the 
same time, we recognize that needs may change over the next few years.  To that end, commenters urge 
the Commission to provide schools and libraries the flexibility to determine how such equipment should

Connectivity Fund Program).  Others suggest using circulation data for library-loaned equipment and services.  See, 
e.g., Buffalo & Erie County Public Library Comments at 6; ALA Comments at 3.
363 This restriction is consistent with 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(3) (“Telecommunications services and network capacity 
provided to a public institutional telecommunications user under this subsection may not be sold, resold, or 
otherwise transferred by such user in consideration for money or any other thing of value.”); see also 47 CFR § 
54.513 (codifying the requirement for E-Rate eligible services).
364 See 47 CFR § 54.1713(b).  This is also consistent with the record on equipment disposal.  See Los Angeles 
Unified School District Comments, Attach. at 3 (estimating that the lifespans of Chromebooks and tablets typically 
range from three to five years); see also SETDA Comments at 5-6 (supporting adoption of the E-Rate Program’s 
five-year equipment retention policy).
365 See 47 U.S.C. § 254(h)(3); see also 47 CFR §§ 54.513(a)-(b), 54.1713(a)-(b).

by children, who often lose, misplace or break devices, and for equipment used at home compared to network 
equipment, which is generally locked away on school or library premises); Joint Venture Silicon Valley et al. 
Comments at 5 (recognizing that the eligible devices under the Emergency Connectivity Fund do not have the same 
expected lifespan as the usual category two networking equipment).

64be treated after the pandemic ends.368  We agree with commenters that argue that schools and libraries are 
in the best position to determine the best use of their equipment.  We therefore allow participating schools 
and libraries to use the equipment after the emergency period for such purposes as the school or library 
considers appropriate, provided that the equipment be used for educational purposes.369  We find this 
approach will provide schools and libraries the flexibility to account for the limited lifespan of eligible 
equipment, while simultaneously combating potential waste, fraud, and abuse.
M. Cost-Effectiveness Analysis
138. The American Rescue Plan requires us to take action by May 10, 2021 to promulgate 
rules for the provision of support from the Emergency Connectivity Fund to schools and libraries for 
specified equipment and services.370  We have no discretion to diverge from statutory direction and thus a 
conventional cost benefit analysis, which would seek to determine whether the costs of the required 
actions exceed their benefits, is not directly called for.371  Instead, we consider whether the actions we 
take today are the most cost-effective means to implement this legislation, recognizing that these actions 
are designed to mitigate a crisis and require swift action.  
139. In that regard, because eligible schools and libraries are already very familiar with the E-
Rate Program, by leveraging, to the extent feasible, existing E-Rate rules and processes to provide support 
from the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program,372 we are adopting the most cost-effective means 
currently at our disposal for timely implementation of the legislative direction.  Those rules have been 
developed through a series of careful, and iterative rulemaking proceedings, and are well understood.  The 
alternative of devising new approaches would lengthen the process of implementation and, given that they 
would need to be developed quickly and without the degree of scrutiny usually applied, they would be 
prone to unintended consequences.  Further, a new process would require the benefiting schools and 
libraries to deal with the unfamiliar, increasing the time and effort they would necessarily expend exactly 
when both those things come at a premium, and increasing the likelihood of error.  We also find that 
limiting funding to schools which certify that they are using support from the Emergency Connectivity 
Fund Program to satisfy otherwise unmet needs for connectivity or for devices of students or staff make 
our actions more cost-effective than other alternatives.   
N. Enforcement 
140. The Public Notice sought comment on imposing administrative forfeitures and other 
penalties on Emergency Connectivity Fund Program participants found to be in violation of the Program 
rules and requirements.373  The record supports the application of our existing enforcement powers, 
including imposing administrative forfeitures and other penalties on participating providers that violate 
the Program rules and requirements, to protect the integrity of the Emergency Connectivity Fund

65Program,374 thus we conclude it is appropriate to use the Commission’s existing, statutorily permitted 
enforcement powers for the Program.  We also find it appropriate to apply the Commission’s suspension 
and debarment rules currently applicable to the Universal Service Fund Programs to the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program participants.375  We will withhold Emergency Connectivity Fund Program 
support from participants found to be in violation of the Program rules, if appropriate, and will also seek 
to recoup improperly disbursed funds, in addition to appropriate enforcement penalties.  We think T-
Mobile’s concern that an “unduly strict approach to enforcement” could discourage participation in the 
Program and undermine the goals of the Program is misplaced.376  The rules we adopt today are 
straightforward and consistent with the goals of the statute, and we do not think a safe harbor to protect 
against good faith errors is warranted.  Instead, we find that these enforcement mechanisms sufficiently 
balance the need for widespread participation in the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program with the 
importance of maintaining the Program’s integrity and protecting the Program from waste, fraud, and 
abuse.
O. Delegations to the Bureau and the Office of Managing Director
141. We delegate authority to the Bureau, in consultation with the Office of the Managing 
Director, to implement the decisions reached here.  Those implementing decisions may include providing 
additional detail and specificity to the requirements of the Program to conform with the decisions in this 
Report and Order, thus ensuring the efficient functioning of this Program.
142. In addition, we delegate financial oversight of this program to the Commission’s 
Managing Director and direct the Office of the Managing Director to work in coordination with the 
Bureau to ensure that all financial aspects of the program have adequate internal controls.  These duties 
fall within the Office of the Managing Director’s current delegated authority to ensure that the 
Commission operates in accordance with federal financial statutes and guidance.377  Such financial 
oversight must be consistent with the rules adopted in this Report and Order.  The Office of the Managing 
Director performs this role with respect to USAC’s administration of the Commission’s Universal Service 
Programs,378 the COVID-19 Telehealth Program,379 and the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program,380 
and we anticipate that the Office of the Managing Director will leverage existing policies and procedures, 
to the extent practicable and consistent with the American Rescue Plan, to ensure the efficient and

66effective management of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.  Finally, we provide that the Office 
of the Managing Director is required to consult with the Bureau on any policy matters affecting the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, consistent with section 0.91(a) of the Commission’s rules.  The 
Office of the Managing Director, in coordination with the Bureau, may issue additional directions to 
USAC and Emergency Connectivity Fund Program participants in furtherance of the decisions reached 
here.
143. We direct the Bureau, as well as the Commission’s Consumer and Governmental Affairs 
Bureau (CGB), to conduct outreach to educate eligible schools and libraries about the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program, and to coordinate, as necessary, with Congressional offices, other federal 
agencies, and state, local and Tribal governments.  We also direct USAC to develop and implement a 
communications strategy, under the oversight of the Bureau, in coordination with CGB, to provide 
training and information necessary for schools and libraries to successfully participate in the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program and provide support to students, school staff, and library patrons who lack 
adequate access to connected devices and broadband connections necessary for remote learning.  At the 
suggestion of several stakeholder groups, we also direct USAC to engage with external users for the 
testing of any new systems for the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program.381  Outreach, education, and 
engagement with eligible schools and libraries will be an important tool in ensuring the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund Program meets its goals of providing connected devices and broadband connections to 
students, school staff, and library patrons that otherwise would lack sufficient access and be unable to 
engage in remote learning and virtual library services.
144. We recognize that, once implementation of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program 
begins, the Bureau or USAC may encounter unforeseen issues or problems with the administration of the 
Program that will need to be resolved.  To promote maximum effectiveness and smooth administration of 
the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program, we delegate this authority to Bureau staff to address and 
resolve such issues related to the administration of the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program provided 
that doing so is consistent with the decisions we reach here today.
IV. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
145.Administrative Procedure Act Exception.  Except those rules that require approval of new 
or revised information collections, which will be effective upon approval of the Office of Management 
and Budget, we find good cause exists for making the rules we adopt today effective upon publication of 
a summary of this Report and Order in the Federal Register.  The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 
provides that with a showing of “good cause,” an agency is permitted to make rules effective before 30 
days after publication in the Federal Register.382  “In determining whether good cause exists, an agency 
should ‘balance the necessity for immediate implementation against principles of fundamental fairness 
which require that all affected persons be afforded a reasonable amount of time to prepare for the 
effective date of its ruling.’”383  As a general matter, we believe that the APA requirements are an 
essential component of our rulemaking process.  In this case, however, because of the unprecedented 
nature of this pandemic and the need for immediate action, we find there is good cause to make the 
Program rules effective upon publication of this Report and Order in the Federal Register.384  Waiting an 
additional 30 days to make this relief available “would undermine the public interest by delaying” 
Congress’ intent to quickly provide resources to eligible schools and libraries to provide the greatly 
needed connectivity and connected devices to enable students, school staff, and library patrons to fully 
engage in remote learning during the COVID-19 emergency period.385

384 5 U.S.C. § 553(d).  See 47 CFR §§ 1.103(a), 1.427(b).Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
67146.Regulatory Flexibility Act.  The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA), 
requires that an agency prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysis “whenever an agency promulgates a 
final rule under [5 U.S.C. § 553], after being required by that section or any other law to publish a general 
notice of proposed rulemaking.”386  We find good cause that the notice and public procedure on the rule 
adopted herein are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and thus no final 
regulatory flexibility analysis is required.  
147.Congressional Review Act.  The Commission has determined, and the Administrator of 
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), concurs, 
that the regulations implementing the Emergency Connectivity Fund Program are a “major rule” under 
the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. § 804(2).  We find for good cause that notice and public 
procedure on the rules adopted herein are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, 
and therefore this Report and Order will become effective upon publication in the Federal Register 
pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 808(2).  The Commission will send a copy of this Report and Order to Congress 
and the Government Accountability Office pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1)(A).
148.Paperwork Reduction Act.  This document contains new or revised information collection 
requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. §§ 3501-3521.  It will be 
submitted to the Office of Management and Budget for review and emergency processing pursuant to 
section 3507(j) of the PRA, 44 U.S.C. § 3507(j).  The Public Notice sought specific comment on how the 
Commission may reduce the information collection burden on small business concerns with fewer than 25 
employees pursuant to 44 U.S.C. § 3506(c)(4). 
149.Late-Filed Comments.  We note there were several comments filed in this proceeding 
after the April 5, 2021 comment deadline.  In the interest of having as complete and accurate record as 
possible, and because we would be free to consider the substance of those filings as part of the record in 
any event,387 we will accept the late-filed comments and waive the requirements of 47 CFR § 1.46(b), and 
have considered them in this Report and Order.  This does not apply to late-filed comments that are 
prohibited under our ex parte rules as modified in this proceeding by the Wireline Competition Bureau in 
a Public Notice dated April 30, 2021. 
V. ORDERING CLAUSES
150. Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to the authority contained in section 7402, 
Title VII of the American Rescue Plan Act, 2021, Pub. L. No. 117-2, 135 Stat. 4, this Report and Order IS 
ADOPTED and SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE upon publication in the Federal Register.
151. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to the authority contained in section 808(2) 
of the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. § 808(2), and 5 U.S.C. § 553(d), this Report and Order 
SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE upon publication in the Federal Register.
(Continued from previous page)  
385 Id.  We also find that the APA’s good cause exception to notice and comment is satisfied.  We find that there was 
good cause to seek comment through a Bureau-level Public Notice, published as a “proposed rule” in the Federal 
Register (85 FR 15172), because of the unprecedented nature of this pandemic and the need for immediate action.  
Because of the 60-day statutory deadline in section 7402 of the American Rescue Plan, if we had issued a 
Commission-level Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, we likely would not have had adequate time to receive and 
incorporate informed comment from interested parties, or to circulate and make public a draft of this Report and 
Order far enough in advance of the statutory deadline to give the public a meaningful opportunity to provide 
feedback.  Thus, issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in these circumstances would have been impracticable 
and not in the public interest, and therefore not required under the “good cause” exception of section 553(b)(B).  See 
5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(B) (permitting deviation from formal rulemaking procedures where the agency “for good cause” 
finds that they are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.”).

Title VII of the American Rescue Plan Act, 2021, Pub. L. No. 117-2, 135 Stat. 4, Part 54 of the 
Commission’s rules, 47 CFR Part 54, is AMENDED as set forth in Appendix A, and such rule 
amendments shall be effective after the publication of this Report and Order in the Federal Register, 
except for those rules which are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act approval process, including  
sections 54.1710(a)-(b), 54.1711(a)-(b), 54.1714, and 54.1715, which will become effective upon 
announcement in the Federal Register of OMB approval of the information collection requirements.
153. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Commission SHALL SEND a copy of this Report 
and Order to the Congress and the Government Accountability Office pursuant to the Congressional 
Review Act, see 5 U.S.C. § 801(a)(1)(A).

75   (3) Not more than 2% of the cap, or approximately $143,420,000, shall be used by the 
Commission and the Administrator for administration of the Emergency Connectivity Fund.
(b) Requests.  The Administrator shall implement an initial filing window, covering funding for purchases 
made between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 for eligible equipment and services provided to students, 
school staff, and library patrons who would otherwise lack connected devices and/or broadband Internet 
access services sufficient to engage in remote learning.  All schools and libraries filing an application 
within that the initial filing period will have their applications treated as if they were simultaneously 
received.  The initial filing period shall conclude after 45 days.  If demand does not exceed available 
funds for the first filing window, the Wireline Competition Bureau will direct the Administrator to open a 
second application window for schools and libraries to seek funding for eligible equipment and services 
schools and libraries previously purchased to address the needs of students, school staff, and library 
patrons who would otherwise have lacked access to the equipment or services sufficient to engage in 
these activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.  During this second application window, applicants will 
be able to submit requests for funding for purchases made from March 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.  
However, in consideration of the importance of providing support for unconnected students, in the event 
that demand for prospective support in the first window appears to be far short of meeting current needs, 
the Commission may consider opening a second prospective window before opening an application 
window to fund previously purchased eligible equipment and services.  If demand does not exceed 
available funds after the close of the second filing window, the Wireline Competition Bureau may direct 
the Administrator to open additional filing windows until the funds are exhausted or the emergency 
period ends, whichever is earlier.   
(c) Rules of distribution.  (1) When the filing window(s) described in paragraph (b) of this section closes, 
the Administrator shall calculate the total demand for support submitted by applicants during the filing 
window.  If total demand exceeds the total support available, the Administrator shall allocate funds to 
these requests for support, beginning with the most economically disadvantaged schools and libraries, as 
determined by the schools and libraries category one discount matrix in § 54.505(c) adjusted to provide a 
five percent increase for rural schools and libraries, as shown in the following matrix.

(2) Schools and libraries eligible for a 95 percent discount shall receive first priority for the funds.  The 
Administrator shall next allocate funds toward the requests submitted by schools and libraries eligible for 
an 90 percent discount, then for a 85 percent discount, and shall continue committing funds in the same Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
76manner to the applicants at each descending discount level until there are no funds remaining.  If the 
remaining funds are not sufficient to support all of the funding requests within a particular discount level, 
the Administrator shall allocate funds at that discount level using the percentage of students eligible for 
the National School Lunch Program.

92STATEMENT OF
ACTING CHAIRWOMAN JESSICA ROSENWORCEL
Re: Establishing the Emergency Connectivity Fund to Close the Homework Gap,
WC Docket No. 21-93
Today the Federal Communications Commission sets up the Emergency Connectivity Fund.  This 
is a big deal.  It’s the largest single effort in our nation’s history to make sure students have access to the 
broadband and devices they need for school.  It will help close the Homework Gap so that kids who have 
been locked out of the virtual classroom can go online for class and do their nightly schoolwork.  Plus, it 
will make it possible for libraries nationwide to offer their patrons—including students—new ways to go 
online and bring connectivity home.
Even before the coronavirus pandemic upended so much of day-to-day life, seven in ten teachers 
were assigning homework that required access to the internet.  But data from this agency demonstrate that 
one in three households do not subscribe to broadband.  Where those numbers overlap is the Homework 
Gap.  
For too long, the Homework Gap has been a troubling and persistent digital equity problem in the 
United States.  But before this cruel virus reached us where we live, many of the students who struggled 
without reliable broadband at home had other options—like sticking around after class, sliding into a seat 
at the public library, or heading to a friend’s home with a connection.  However, with classes themselves 
moving online and the pandemic requiring us to stay home, we went from having millions of children 
who couldn’t do online homework assignments to having millions of children who couldn’t do 
schoolwork at all.  In other words, the Homework Gap became a full-fledged learning and education gap.
According to one estimate, there are close to 17 million students who fall into this learning limbo.  
These children are disproportionately Black, Latino, and American Indian or Alaska Natives.  They live 
in rural and urban communities and everywhere in between.  It’s a problem that unites us nationwide—
and it’s one we absolutely need to fix.
It’s also important that we address this now.  Because as we exit this pandemic, we know that 
education has been changed.  Like so much else in our lives, it has been digitized.  There are new ways of 
teaching, learning, researching, and collaborating that we will take with us out of this period.  When we 
do, we need to ensure that every student gets the connectivity they need to thrive so no child is left 
offline.  
Of all the memories and images of the past months, the one that keeps coming back to me is a 
viral picture of two young girls sitting outside a Taco Bell. They were sitting cross-legged on the ground 
with laptops on their knees, using the free Wi-Fi from the restaurant to do their schoolwork.  It was heart-
wrenching to see.  But they were not alone.  Kids elsewhere sat in cars outside of libraries to catch a 
signal to go online for class.  Others cobbled together the connectivity they needed by doing everything 
from borrowing mobile phones to lingering outside of shuttered school and municipal buildings.  
We should salute the grit of each and every one of these young people who found ways to go 
online and keep up with school.  But it shouldn’t be this hard—and going forward it won’t.
That’s because today, pursuant to Section 7402 of the American Rescue Plan Act, we set up the 
Emergency Connectivity Fund.  This legislation provides the FCC with $7.171 billion to help schools and 
libraries get people connected where they live.  This means we have a terrific opportunity get devices—
laptops and tablets—into the hands of students, staff, and library patrons who lack them and connect these 
learners to fixed or mobile broadband service at home.  It means we can help address the Homework Gap 
and get more students and households nationwide connected to the high-speed internet service that is now 
needed to fully participate in education and modern life.  
I want to thank each of my colleagues for reviewing these rules and providing their input on an 
especially fast schedule.  I want to thank Commissioner Carr for putting a premium on prospective relief Federal Communications Commission FCC 21-58
93and encouraging stakeholder input while keeping to our tight statutory deadline.  I want to thank 
Commissioner Starks for his creative ideas about collecting data so that we size the Homework Gap 
across the country and fix it once and for all.  I also want to thank Commissioner Simington for his focus 
on remote communities and his thoughtful suggestion that rural schools and libraries would benefit from a 
further boost.    
Last but not least, I am grateful to the expert staff of this agency, who released a public draft of 
this item just 50 days after the American Rescue Plan Act was signed into law and worked many nights 
and weekends to get us over the finish line.  From the Wireline Competition Bureau, Cheryl Callahan,

94STATEMENT OF
COMMISSIONER BRENDAN CARR
Re: Establishing the Emergency Connectivity Fund to Close the Homework Gap,
WC Docket No. 21-93
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made access to the Internet more important than ever 
before, including for millions of America’s students.  Last year, several organizations estimated that it 
would require approximately $6.8 billion in support to ensure that every school kid in this country has 
access to a high-speed Internet connection.  That is why my priority in this proceeding has been to ensure 
that the $7.2 billion initiative we stand up today focuses on bringing all of those still unconnected 
students across the digital divide.  
I want to extend my thanks and appreciation to Acting Chairwoman Rosenworcel and my other 
colleagues for agreeing to a series of significant changes to the decision we reach today—all of which 
prioritize the needs of America’s unconnected students.  As originally drafted, there was a risk that the 
FCC’s decision would not have connected a single unconnected student, focusing instead on reimbursing 
schools for the work they did over the past year to bring students across the digital divide.  The final order 
we adopt today now gives us a fair shot at ensuring that 100 percent of the $7.2 billion goes towards 
connecting those students that remain offline.  Indeed, our first application window will now be 
exclusively focused on providing equipment and services on a forward-looking basis to unconnected 
students.  We also leave open the possibility of a second window for prospective funding before looking 
to reimburse school systems for their past expenses.  This approach ensures that school kids who are 
unconnected today are the ones who benefit from this program, as intended by Congress.
I appreciate that my colleagues also agreed to a series of additional changes.  We now provide 
rural students with a fairer shot at receiving an equitable distribution of these funds.  We now recognize 
that homeschooled children are eligible for support through this program, as well as qualifying students 
that attend private school.  We now ensure that any funding for school staff, rather than students, is 
limited to those staff that will be providing educational services to students.  We now take steps to allow 
broadcast Internet services, including ATSC 3.0 offerings, to play a role in connecting unconnected 
students.  We now have a series of additional checks against waste, fraud, and abuse.  And we now take 
additional steps to ensure that these limited funds are not spent overbuilding existing networks.
Finally, I would like to extend my thanks to Acting Chairwoman Rosenworcel for releasing a 
public draft of the item, which allowed for public feedback.  This was not an action required by law, but 
her decision to do so brought an important level of transparency and public participation to this process.  
Our final decision has been greatly improved as a result.  I also want to recognize the FCC staff who have 
worked quickly—through long nights and weekends—in preparing the order we adopt today.

95STATEMENT OF
COMMISSIONER GEOFFREY STARKS
Re: Establishing the Emergency Connectivity Fund to Close the Homework Gap, 
WC Docket No. 21-93
Last week, the New York Times highlighted the challenges facing Jordyn Coleman, a fifth-grade 
student in Clarksdale, Mississippi.  Jordyn, who transferred schools during the pandemic, described his 
struggles with online school.  Jordyn’s family does not have internet access at home, and he can only 
participate in virtual classes by using his mother’s cellphone.  But his mother works night shifts as a 
security guard at a casino and, like most of us, takes her phone with her.  Ms. Coleman has difficulty 
making it home in time for Jordyn’s first morning classes due to her 40-mile commute on public 
transportation.  Consistently connecting to online lessons would no doubt be easier with a home Wi-Fi 
connection.  But for a family that has faced stiff economic headwinds during the pandemic, other basic 
needs have to come first.  Ms. Coleman usually makes dinner on a hot plate or in an electric pot, because 
she does not have a refrigerator or stove in her apartment.  She told the Times, “My priorities are a stove, 
a fridge, a car. . . . Then maybe we can talk about internet.”1  Millions of households are in the same spot.
Stories like Jordyn’s illustrate a basic truth: families that are struggling during the pandemic 
should not have to choose between Internet and devices for their children—requirements for an equitable 
education—and paying for basic necessities.  Internet access is a necessity.  Beginning in March 2020, 
school for many children transformed into a virtual institution nearly overnight—locking millions of 
students without broadband and adequate devices out of the classroom.  Though many schools and other 
organizations have worked to close the gap, Boston Consulting Group reported that as of January 2021, 
up to 12 million K-12 students remain digitally underserved.2  And the problem is most significant in 
communities of color.  The divide disproportionately affects Black, Latinx, and Native American 
students.  Students of color, who make up 40% of the population, collectively make up 54% of the 
divide.3
The educational consequences have been significant.  For many years, we have recognized that 
students who go home to a place without internet access after school miss important opportunities.  
During the pandemic, when so many children are learning at home all day, no home broadband access can 
mean no access to education.  The Homework Gap has turned into a learning chasm.  Researchers at 
McKinsey & Company found that, due to the pandemic and the transition to remote learning, on average, 
students could lose five to nine months of learning by the end of June 2021.4  Students of color could be 
six to twelve months behind, compared with four to eight months for white students.5  Other researchers

96have concluded that the pandemic has put low-income students in most grades “substantially further 
behind than higher-income students.”6  
Earlier this year, I heard directly from students about how challenging the transition to remote 
learning has been.  In February, I met with students and Principal Willie Brewster from Brenda Scott 
Academy in Detroit, Michigan.  Brenda Scott Academy is a performing arts school at which 88% of 
students are Black and 80% of students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.  I met with middle school 
students who talked about their dreams of one day working in digital animation, film, and civil rights law.  
While I learned about the students’ dreams, I also gained insight into their reality.  They spoke about both 
the successes and challenges of their experiences with online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Students were in need of faster, more reliable broadband, so they can engage in synchronous learning.  
They also needed upgraded devices, so they are not as dependent on their cell phones to learn.  The most 
striking moment was when one eighth grader said plainly that she “needed a better internet.”
I agree, and that is why I am pleased to approve today’s Order.  This essential $7.17 billion 
investment in our children, society, and future leaders has the potential to change the lives of children 
who need support to get the most out of school—especially those in low-income communities.  The 
Emergency Connectivity Fund will also support the many Americans who rely on their local library for 
connectivity and access to educational resources.  By leveraging the E-Rate program’s discount matrix, 
the framework we adopt today will prioritize our country’s highest-need schools and libraries.
I am especially pleased that the Commission has made special provisions for organizations that 
serve students, staff, and patrons with disabilities.  A group of 13 organizations representing people with 
disabilities demonstrated in the record how connected devices support accessible video conferencing 
platforms and other software necessary to ensure students who are deaf, hard of hearing, deafblind, or 
deaf with mobility issues can fully participate in the remote learning experience.7  These students can 
experience accessibility problems when using video conferencing platforms that do not provide 
captioning, causing them to miss crucial information during class.8  But accessible equipment can be 
expensive.  Giving organizations that serve students with disabilities the opportunity to see a waiver from 
the standard price cap for connected devices will ensure that these students, staff, and patrons receive 
equipment that meets their educational needs.
I also thank my colleagues for agreeing to changes to the draft Order that will allow the 
Commission to gather data that is critical to creating better policy.  As I have consistently stated—from 
the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to today’s Emergency Connectivity Fund—we must push for better, 
clearer data to drive sound policymaking.  And when so many schools were forced to go online-only in 
spring 2020, many collected information about students who needed devices or connections.  More than a 
year into the pandemic, many of those schools have refined their data-gathering techniques to get an even 
clearer picture of which students are still in need of devices and connectivity.  By adding a few basic 
questions to the Emergency Connectivity Fund application, the Commission will gain insight about where

97the Homework Gap is and how wide the gap is.  This information will help inform all of us, including 
policymakers.
While I am confident that the Emergency Connectivity Fund will improve the educational 
outlook of millions of children across the country, I am mindful that making sure every child has the 
necessary digital tools will require a long-term commitment.  Tens of millions of Americans lacked 
access to broadband services long before COVID-19, and the digital divide will not go away when the 
coronavirus does.  For example, in October 2019, before the pandemic, as many as 40% of Detroit 
residents did not have an Internet connection in their home.9  Even when students are back in the 
classroom full time, equitable education will require connectivity at home.  The Emergency Connectivity 
Fund is an important step forward, but we also need to develop a long-term solution.
I thank the Commission staff who have put a tremendous amount of effort and expertise into 
preparing this Order on a short timeline.  Your unwavering dedication will ensure members of our most 
vulnerable communities experience the transformative impact of broadband connectivity.

98STATEMENT OF
COMMISSIONER NATHAN SIMINGTON
Re: Establishing the Emergency Connectivity Fund to Close the Homework Gap,
WC Docket No. 21-93
It is my pleasure to vote to approve the Report and Order establishing the Emergency 
Connectivity Fund to Close the Homework Gap.  The Fund’s size is closely tailored to the amount 
estimated to be required to ensure that all students nationwide have access to broadband during the 
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  This program will connect currently unserved students, school staff, and 
library patrons so that they can all engage in remote learning on a level playing field with their connected 
peers.  This is an important part of closing the larger digital divide and will encourage broadband 
adoption.   
I particularly appreciate the analysis and suggestions provided by the stakeholders who reached 
out to point out changes that needed to be made to the original draft, and to Acting Chairwoman 
Rosenworcel, her advisors, and the outstanding Wireline Competition Bureau team that took so many 
stakeholders’ concerns to heart and made changes to the Report and Order as originally proposed.  We 
particularly appreciated that the final Report and Order recognizes that the priority of this program is to 
serve those not yet served, while providing necessary financial support for reimbursements of necessary 
past spending the minute that those needs have been satisfied.  Congress gave the Commission a mandate 
to connect currently unconnected students, and I believe that this mandate will be fulfilled in the final 
Report and Order. 
Further, I appreciate the clarity thoughtfully added to the original draft.  Two points to 
particularly note are the addition of standards and clarifying language on when self-construction would be 
appropriate, and the guardrails added for all program participants to guarantee that funds from this 
program will go for remote learning as intended by Congress.  Changes made to clarify that the $400 
equipment cap is on reimbursements rather than prices, and language requiring additional information on 
broadband availability championed by Commissioner Starks, both significantly improved the Report and 
Order.     
The final Report and Order prioritizes rural users when funds are nearing depletion, 
accommodates non-profit private schools and includes homeschoolers, as championed by Commissioner 
Carr.  The inclusion of ATSC 3.0 datacasting as appropriate technology for self-provisioned systems, as 
requested by both Commissioner Carr and my office, is also an important addition to the Report and 
Order. 
I also appreciated the opportunity to discuss my call for protection of school and library data.  
Though not included in the Report and Order, I look forward to working on this issue in future E-Rate 
discussions.  Now, when many of our schools and library systems are suffering attacks targeting student 
and faculty personal data, and when critical infrastructure is more and more subject to damaging hacks 
and cyber-attacks, we must ensure that E-Rate support provides safe, secure technology.
The collegial process by which the Commission has jointly arrived at this final Report and Order 
was made particularly effective by Acting Chairwoman Rosenworcel’s release of a public draft. 
Education is a vast field.  The final Report and Order benefited from the input of a wide range of 
concerned parties, which could not help but refine our work at the Commission, allowed us to carefully 
assess the ramifications of every choice we made, and made our final Report and Order more transparent 
and informed than it would have been otherwise. 
I fully support this Report and Order and am honored to vote for it.  Thank you again for all who 
worked to get it into this final form. I look forward to hearing great things from this effort.
