Commission’s Web site and the Web sites of video programming distributors (if they have them), and in billing statements (to the extent video programming distributors issue them). 
In addition, the Commission seeks to 
extend proposed information collection requirements. Specifically, on July 21, 2005, the Commission released Closed Captioning of Video Programming; Telecommunications for the Deaf, Inc. 
Petition for Rulemaking, CG Docket No. 05–231, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, FCC 05–142, published at 70 FR 56150 on September 26, 2005 (Closed Captioning Notice of Proposed Rulemaking), which sought comment on several issues pertaining to these closed captioning rules (47 CFR 79.1). The Closed Captioning Notice of Proposed Rulemaking sought comment, inter alia, on whether petitions for exemption from the closed captioning rules should be permitted (or required) to be filed electronically through the Commission’s Electronic Comment Filing System, and whether video programming distributors should be required to submit compliance reports to the Commission in cases where the final required amount of captioning post phase-in (e.g., pre-rule programming) is not 100 percent. These proposed information collection requirements remain pending.
