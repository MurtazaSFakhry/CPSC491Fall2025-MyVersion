Federal Emergency Management AgencyAbstract
In the United States, alerting authorities are authorized by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) to notify the public of imminent hazards and threats by
sending Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs) through the Integrated Public Alert and
Warning System (IPAWS). Although recent efforts have been made to examine
historical WEA compliance with frameworks such as Mileti and Sorenson's (1990)
Warning Response Model, less attention has been paid to information included in
WEAs that is not prescribed by message design frameworks from risk communica-
tion scholarship. This paper explores the presence of Situational Crisis Communica-
tion Theory's (SCCT) instructing and adjusting information in terse mobile alerts.
The authors conducted a content analysis of 4777 WEAs sent between 2019 and
2022 to determine how often and in which contexts (i.e., hazard types, 90 ‐or
360 ‐character messages) these strategies are used. We find that the limited
definition of adjusting information used in prior research (e.g., direction to mental
health resources) is rarely included in WEAs. Additionally, we identify differences in
use by message length (90 ‐vs. 360 ‐characters) and hazard type. We conclude that
adjusting information in WEAs most frequently takes the form of organisational
response information, thereby amending prior definitions of adjusting information to
more closely align with the objectives and goals of warning message design.

In the United States, there are over 1600 alerting authorities (AAs)
authorized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
to issue alerts and warnings for imminent threats through the
Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS; Federal
Emergency Management Agency, 2020 ). Since 2012, AAs have had
the capability to notify the public of imminent threats through IPAWS
using Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs), which are short messages
sent to mobile devices in at ‐risk areas using geotargeted broadcast
technology (Federal Emergency Management Agency, 2020 ). When
reading through these messages, those familiar with WEAs will
recognize some hallmark terms of risk messaging: ‘take shelter
now ’,‘mandatory evacuation ’,‘shelter in place ’, and so on. Closerinspection, though, shows other phrases exist in WEAs that are not
prescribed by Mileti and Sorensen's ( 1990 ) Warning Response Model
(WRM), the pre ‐eminent framework for warning message design and
evaluation (e.g., Kuligowski et al., 2023 ; Sutton et al., 2020 ). For
example, residents in Garysburg, North Carolina, received a WEA
from their county emergency management office stating: 'There is a
water main break [ …] We have crews working to repair the problem'
(Public Broadcasting Service Warning, Alert, & Response Network
Public Broadcast System Warning, Alert, and Response Net-
work, 2022 ), indicating that the local jurisdiction is actively
responding to the event. Another sent to residents of Grundy
County, Illinois, states 'Grundy County Sheriff is issuing a law

enforcement emergency due to an officer involved shooting' (Public
Broadcast System Warning, Alert, and Response Network, 2021b ),
strategically placing the sheriff as the issuing authority for the
emergency. These details do not provide specifics about where
exactly the incidents are, when they occurred, how severe they are,or what residents should do to protect themselves, which are
commonly cited elements from the WRM. Instead, they draw
attention to the fact that there is an ongoing official response tothe hazard in question and describe efforts to address the hazard andits impacts —or what we define as 'organisational response informa-
tion'. We observe that organisational response information is present
in WEAs but is not prescribed by the WRM. Several questions arisefrom these observations: why do AAs include this information? Are
they attempting to reassure publics that the situation is under
control? What are the effects of this information on warningoutcomes? Are there conditional (i.e., hazard ‐specific) benefits of
including it in WEAs? Before answering these questions, however, it
is important to understand how frequently these contents areincluded in WEAs and the types of official responses they describe.
The main objective of this study is to document and quantify
organisational response information in WEAs by drawing fromtheories of both risk and crisis communication to help conceptualizethis information in alerts and warnings. Although risk and crisis
communication theories generally have distinct approaches to
studying communication pertaining to hazards and crises, each hasproduced theories to guide risk or crisis messaging and predict
outcomes related to such messages. Some theories/frameworks
share similar constructs: for example, Mileti and Sorensen's ( 1990 )
WRM and Coombs's ( 2007 ) Situational Crisis Communication Theory
(SCCT) both recommend that officials provide protective action
guidance, or 'instructing information', to help publics physically copewith and protect themselves from threats. Despite these similarities,the applications for these frameworks in extant literature are quite
distinct. The WRM is oriented toward disaster risk messaging to
facilitate protective actions, whereas SCCT takes a more organisa-tionally focused approach to crisis response, with reputation as a
primary outcome of interest. Thus, the application of recommenda-
tions from SCCT (namely, to provide 'adjusting information' such asemotional coping advice or details of corrective actions to help
receivers psychologically cope with the crisis) has not been
extensively studied in the context of alert and warning messagessuch as WEAs. As a result, it is unknown if the more organisationally
oriented messaging strategies derived from SCCT are used, or have
positive effects, in terse messaging spaces. However, crisis commu-nication theories like SCCT may help to explain why AAs wouldinclude information that falls outside the scope of the WRM.
With this in mind, we conduct a deductive content analysis of 4777
WEAs sent by state and local AAs in the United States from 2019 to2022 to determine how frequently instructing and adjusting information
are included in these WEAs. Our analyses also assess how the inclusion
of organisational response informat ion differs (a) between messages of
different lengths (WEAs can be 90 ‐or 360 ‐characters), and (b) across
different hazard types (i.e., natural, technological, human ‐induced). Indoing so, we begin to identify the practices that have been enacted by
AAs that communicate about the organisation in addition to publicsafety. In the next section, we review the relevant literature on alerts,
warnings, and crisis communicatio n to identify the contents that are
recommended for messages to effectively communicate about immi-nent threats and organisational response efforts.
1|LITERATURE REVIEW
1.1 |Alerts and warnings
WEAs, issued through FEMA's Integrated Public Alert and Warning
System, were first introduced in 2012 as a means for AAs at the
federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial levels to quickly notify thepublic of impending threats using text ‐based, geotargeted messages
that are not affected by cellular network congestion like Short
Messaging Service (SMS) messages (Federal Emergency ManagementAgency, 2020 ). Unlike other public alerting channels, WEA does not
require the message receiver to opt ‐in (e.g., signing up through an
app) or seek out information (e.g., through television or internet) toreceive an alert. WEAs were originally limited to 90 characters butwere expanded in 2019 to include 360 characters (Federal
Emergency Management Agency, 2020 ; National Weather Ser-
vice, 2022 ). This allows WEAs to shift from serving as alerts, which
serve to attract attention and promote further information seeking,
to warnings, which serve to provide details about the hazard and
recommended protective actions (Bean, 2019 ). Thus, the addition of
270 more characters enables AAs to potentially make their messages
more specific and to also include all the contents recommended in
the WRM.
Within the disaster and risk communication research space, the
WRM is the pre ‐eminent model informing the design of effective
alerts and warnings for the purpose of motivating publics to take
protective actions. The contents included in the WRM were initiallyidentified by Mileti and Sorensen ( 1990 ) following a review of
empirical studies on behavioural outcomes for disasters. They
identified five key contents that, when included, increase thelikelihood of timely and appropriate behavioural response by
reducing the likelihood of additional information seeking, or milling
(Mileti & Sorensen, 1990 ; Wood et al., 2018 ). These contents are (a)
the name of the message source (i.e., who is sending the message,
such as 'Central City Sheriff'), (b) a description of the hazard and its
expected impacts (such as 'hazardous material spill: exposure tochemicals could cause difficulty breathing'), (c) guidance for protec-tive actions (such as 'take shelter in an interior room at the lowest
point in the building'), (d) timing information, such as the time of
hazard impact, when protective action should take place, and/orwhen the message expires, and (e) the location(s) affected by the
hazard (i.e., 'at the intersection of Main and 1st' or 'near the Central
Public Library'; Mileti, 2018 ; Mileti & Sorensen, 1990 ).
The WRM also offers guidelines for warning message style, that
is, how an effective message should be composed. Warnings that are2o f1 1 |CAIN ET AL.

specific (i.e., providing details about the location and timing of
the event), consistent (i.e., indicating the same hazard and the sameactions as warnings issued in parallel over other channels), accurate
(i.e., representing the conditions correctly, so that they correspond
with what is occurring), certain (i.e., using language i.e. not hedging orcontaining likelihoods or probabilities), and clear (i.e., using language
i.e. unambiguous and directive) lead to better message under-
standing, personalising, believing, and ability to decide to act,preventing information seeking that delays a protective actionresponse (Mileti & Sorensen, 1990 ; Wood et al., 2018 ). Alert and
warning message contents and style have also been shown to
improve message receivers ’trust in the message, which positively
affects behavioural intention (Burgeno & Joslyn, 2020 ; Weyrich
et al., 2019 ). Additional research employing the WRM articulates the
requisite order of contents for WEA messages (see Woodet al., 2015 ).
The WRM has been used to inform message design and
evaluation for imminent threat hazards including wildfires (Kuligowskiet al., 2023 ), earthquakes (Sutton, Wood, et al., 2020 ,2023 ),
tornadoes (Sutton et al., 2021 ), tsunamis (Sutton et al., 2018 ), and
snow squalls and dust storms (Fischer et al., 2023 ), as well as human ‐
induced threats such as radiological and active shooter events (Woodet al., 2015 ). However, AAs are not bound by FEMA to specific
messaging rules such as those articulated in the WRM. Furthermore,
AAs can issue a WEA for nearly any threat, event, or public safetyissue they deem relevant to their population at risk. Therefore, WEA
contents and design differ by hazard and location, as well as AA
practices and policies. Recent efforts have been made to examinehow WEAs conform to the WRM contents overall (Olson et al., 2023 )
and to determine message completeness and language consistency
for a single hazard type (e.g., Kuligowski et al., 2023 ). Recognising
that the WRM focuses solely on outcomes related to protectiveaction response, the inclusion of content in WEAs that is not
prescribed by the WRM (such as the recommended contents from
SCCT) has yet to be investigated in this space. We now turn toframeworks from crisis communication scholarship to help contextu-
alize such contents.
1.2 |Crisis communication
Theories and frameworks from risk communication such as the
WRM centre around 'persuading individuals to take action to limit
risk, whereas crisis communication focuses on responding toimmediate public needs for inform ation' to reduce uncertainty,
thereby ensuring that stakeholders can understand and respond to
the crisis (Veil et al., 2008 ,p .2 8 ) .T h u s ,t h e o r i e sa n dm o d e l so f
crisis communication typically focus on organisational outcomessuch as reputation, or overall impressions of the organisation's
favorability (Coombs, 2010 ). However, crises can come with
additional or associated risks that require timely and effectivemessages to motivate protective action (Veil et al., 2008 ), intro-
ducing an element of public safety and related behaviouraloutcomes (e.g., protective action behaviour) that are traditionally
the focus of warning communication. Importantly, crisis communi-
cation and warning communication scholars alike have found that
reputational factors, in addition to the message content and style
elements identified in the WRM, c an influence protective action
behaviours in high ‐risk situations (DeYoung et al., 2019 ). From
qualitative research with residents of Hawaii who received a false
alert for an incoming interconti nental ballistic missile, DeYoung
et al. ( 2019 ) found that many participants sought to confirm the
alert with other sources due to lack of trust in the original message.
Additionally, message receivers e xpressed decreased trust in the
organisation and increased concerns about the legitimacy of futuremessages, should another alert be issued (DeYoung et al., 2019 ).
One crisis communication theory that provides messaging
recommendations for all types of organisations facing crises,including public safety organisations, is SCCT (Coombs, 2007 ). SCCT
is a prescriptive framework that can guide crisis response by
considering the amount of responsibility the public is likely toattribute to the responding organisation during a crisis event (Fediuk
et al., 2010 ). The theory includes response strategies for a variety of
crises, including those where the organisation is a victim of the crisis(e.g., natural disasters, rumours), accidents (e.g., technical errors), andintentional incidents (e.g., organisational misdeeds, human error;
Coombs, 2007 ). SCCT states that the levels of responsibility
attributed to an organisation will depend on if the organisation is avictim of the crisis —or suffers losses and was not responsible for
causing the crisis —as well as its prior crisis history (i.e., past or
recurring organisational misdeeds) and reputation (Ulmer et al., 2018 ).
SCCT also argues that organisations can effectively influence
stakeholder perceptions of a crisis and their attributions of
responsibility by creating effective messages in response to the crisis.
Response message strategies should consider the level of
organisational responsibility for the crisis and its prior crisis history.
However, regardless of organisational responsibility or prior history,
SCCT recommends that crisis communicators include a base responseconsisting of instructing and adjusting information to help the public
cope physically and psychologically, respectively, as they manage
their response and recovery (Coombs, 2007 ; Sturges, 1994 ; Zhang &
Zhou, 2020 ). In other words, officials should address the primary
informational needs of those at risk by providing information that
tells people how to protect themselves (i.e., instructing information)and helps them to cope with the emotional stress and uncertainty of
a crisis (i.e., adjusting information). Importantly, Coombs ( 2007 )
explains that these types of information should be provided as soonas possible after a crisis occurs and before any reputation repair
efforts, such as denying responsibility, attacking accusers, or
apologising. Providing 'a complete overview of relevant instructing
and adjusting information' during a crisis can reduce anxiety anduncertainty for message receivers and increase their trust in the
source, thereby protecting reputation without engaging in explicit
reputation repair efforts (Claeys et al., 2022 , p. 360). By providing
instructing and adjusting information as part of the initial organisa-
tional response, organisations demonstrate that they are activelyCAIN ET AL. |3o f1 1

helping victims of a crisis, which can help to minimize reputational
damage for the organisation (Coombs, 2015 ). Next, we describe
instructing and adjusting information in greater detail.
1.2.1 |Instructing information
Instructing information focuses on information directing people to
physically protect themselves from a crisis (Coombs, 2015 ). This
concept closely aligns with Mileti and Sorensen's ( 1990 ) definition of
protective action guidance from the WRM and includes public safety ‐
oriented calls to action (Coombs, 2015 ) such as 'shelter in
place', 'avoid the area', or 'leave now'. Although instructing informa-
tion should be provided as soon as possible during a crisis
(Sturges, 1994 ), the SCCT literature lacks specific message design
recommendations regarding the contents and style of instructing
information beyond providing highly instructive information (Claeys
et al., 2022 ) that directs physical response to a crisis, including
descriptions of who could be affected, how to get to safety, and how
to protect oneself (Page, 2020 ).
1.2.2 |Adjusting information
Adjusting information focuses on information that can help people
cope with the emotional stress and uncertainty of a crisis. According
to Coombs ( 2007 ), 'a crisis creates a need for information. The
uncertainty of a crisis produces stress for stakeholders. To cope withthis psychological stress, stakeholders need information about what
had just happened' (p. 165). Adjusting information is important for
psychological coping and stakeholder well ‐being, but some scholars
have also indicated that it should be provided immediately after,
rather than during, the crisis (Page, 2020 ; Sturges, 1994 ).
Adjusting information can take several forms such as expressions
of concern, solidarity, and sympathy for victims of the crisis(Coombs, 2010 ); information about mental health resources available
to victims and their family members (Liu et al., 2020 ); and details of
corrective actions being taken by the organisation (e.g., actions beingtaken to prevent a repeat of the event; Coombs, 2010 ; Page, 2020 ).
Page ( 2020 ), however, expanded upon the definition of adjusting
information, arguing that 'providing an explanation of the causes andresolution of a crisis' (p. 3) can also serve as adjusting information.
Page ( 2020 ) conducted a series of interviews evaluating the extent to
which explanations and resolution affected public perceptions oforganisational reputation for a fictitious company facing a reputa-tional crisis. They found that interviewees preferred messages
explaining what had happened during the crisis, with particular
emphasis on how the crisis was resolved. This kind of adjustinginformation assured message receivers that they were safe and that
the organisation cared for their well ‐being (Page, 2020 ). Indeed,
many crisis communication scholars have found that adjustinginformation that provides details about the organisational response
or corrective actions can reduce psychological stress and uncertaintyby assuring the public that the organisation is in control of the
situation and cares about their well ‐being, thereby protecting the
organisation's reputation (Kim & Sung, 2014 ; Page, 2020 ; Sellnow
et al., 1998 ; Zhang & Zhou, 2020 ).
However, SCCT prescribes strategies for responding to crises
broadly, as it was developed for crisis response strategies, not alert and
warning communication. Importantly , the character limitations for WEAs
may prevent the inclusion of detailed descriptions of corrective actionsand other forms of adjusting information. In fact, results from a studyassessing the inclusion and use of inst ructing and adjusting information in
government Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and official website posts
found that only 26.5% of posts include d information about organisational
efforts to minimize harm (i.e., c orrective actions; Liu et al., 2020 ). Although
this study coded corrective actions sepa rately from adjusting information,
these contents do fit the definition of adjusting information providedby Coombs ( 2010 )a n dP a g e( 2020 ). This information was less likely to
appear on Twitter, which limits messages to 280 characters, in
comparison with channels that do not p lace limitations on content length
such as Facebook (Liu et al., 2020 ).
Furthermore, crisis communication scholarship, such as SCCT,
emphasizes the importance of instructing information for messagesshared with victims during the crisis, especially 'during health crises,product recalls, natural disasters, and other events that threaten
public safety and well ‐being' (Kim et al., 2011 , p. 185). However, the
nature of the hazard (including whether there are victims) and level ofhuman intervention required to resolve the hazard (e.g., officers
needing to apprehend a suspect) may result in varied use of adjusting
information between different hazard types.
1.3 |Summary
In summary, the WRM model prescribes the inclusion of five
contents: source, hazard, location, guidance, and time. The inclusion
of organisational response information, which we argue is a form ofadjusting information, does not align with the WRM. Although
instructing information is similar to protective action guidance found
in the WRM, there is no equivalent for adjusting information in theexisting WRM framework. We have observed both instructing and
adjusting information (namely, organisational response information)
in previously sent WEAs (see Public Broadcast System Warning,Alert, and Response Network, 2022 ); however, it remains unknown
how frequently this content is included, whether these contents are
more prevalent in longer or shorter WEAs, and whether theirinclusion differs by hazard type. Given the dearth of research on theuse of crisis communication strategies in alert and warning messages,
we pose the following research questions:
RQ1. How frequently is instructing information and adjusting
information included in WEAs?
RQ2. What types of adjusting information are included
in WEAs?4o f1 1 |CAIN ET AL.

RQ3. How does instructing and adjusting information inclusion
differ by WEA length (90or360 characters )?
RQ4. How does instructing and adjusting information use differ
by hazard type?
2|METHODS
We conducted a quantitative content analysis of 4777 WEAs
obtained from FEMA ‐IPAWS sent between 2019 and 2022. WEAs
were manually coded for completeness (i.e., inclusion of the fivecontents identified in the WRM; where content on guidance is
equivalent to instructing information), their inclusion of adjusting
information (including organisational response information), andhazard type. Descriptive analyses and/or chi ‐square tests were
conducted to illustrate differences in use of instructing and adjusting
information between 90 ‐and 360 ‐character messages and between
WEAs for various hazard types.
2.1 |Sample
The sampling frame for this study includes the historical record of
WEAs sent by state, local, tribal, and territorial AAs from 2012 to2022 ( n= 7645). For this analysis, we narrowed this sample to include
WEAs sent between December 18, 2019, and April 13, 2022
(n= 6252). The start of this timeframe coincides with the introduction
of 360 ‐character WEAs. We do not include messages from federal
sources such as the National Weather Service or the National Centre
for Missing and Exploited Children. Additionally, duplicate messages(i.e., identical messages sent as both 90 ‐and 360 ‐character WEAs,
n= 1104) and post ‐alert or cancellation messages ( n= 445) were
excluded from the content analysis, yielding a sample of 4777messages. Only the content of the messages themselves was coded;
any information linked through URLs was not included in the analysis.
2.2 |Coding scheme
All WEAs in the sample were coded for completeness (i.e., containing
source, hazard, location, protective action guidance/instructing infor-mation, and time information; Mileti & Sorensen, 1990 ). WEAs were
also coded for presence or absence of content that represented
adjusting information. Adjusting information was defined as informa-
tion related to psychological coping advice or resources (Liu et al., 2020 )
and/or details of official organisational response efforts. Inclusion
of adjusting information as psychological coping advice was indicated
by content directing readers to mental health resources. Inclusion oforganisational response information was indicated by language that
described official actions to directly address the hazard or hazard
impacts in question before, during, or after the initial event. Our codingcriteria are detailed in the following paragraphs and summarized in
Table 1with italics added to emphasize contents that qualified
messages for inclusion.
The coding scheme was developed via inductive content analysis.
We extracted and recorded language used to describe organisational
response efforts to build a lexicon of response types (e.g., issuing,
working, ordering, etc.). From this lexicon, two main categories ofresponse emerged: actions , that is, organisational physical response
activities, and orders , or enforceable statements designed to initiate
public response. We then identified content describing an organisa-tion's active response to a named hazardous event as a form of
adjusting information. For example: 'crews have restored services'
following a water main break points to (a) an organisation ('crews')and (b) physical response ('restored services') to manage and/orresolve a hazard during or following the hazard event. Therefore, the
passive version (e.g., 'service has been restored') would not be coded
TABLE 1 Examples of adjusting information coding criteria.
Decision Example message Explanation
Included Spokane County Fire District 4 is keeping Level 2 evacuations in place
for the Nelson Creek Fire . Residents from East Bridges S to E
Nelson Rd and N Madison East to N Jackson Rd should still stay
prepared and monitor your phones.This message positions the fire district as making an official
decision regarding evacuation status. This action aims to
mitigate the wildfire threat.
Law enforcement is in the area along Hwy 71 between County Roads Y
and Z looking for a suspected armed suspect . Stay inside and lock
doors. Remove Keys from outside vehicles. Call 911 if youobserve anyone suspicious.This message includes detail that law enforcement personnel are
actively looking for the suspect.
Northampton Public Works is currently working to repair a watermain
break in your area.This message demonstrates a strategic choice in language to depict
Public Works as actively working to repair an issue.
Excluded Santa Maria PD Requesting resident shelter in place at this time due
to police activity.This message positions Santa Maria PD as the source of a request
to shelter in place, but 'requesting' does not hold the same legal
significance as terms like 'issuing' or 'ordering'.
The water system in Avon has been repaired . Boil water for human
use until 6.14.21 @ 3 PM.This message does not identify who repaired the water system, and
the reader cannot assume that an official source is responsible.CAIN ET AL. |5o f1 1

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
as adjusting information, as the role of an organisation in reaching
that resolution is unclear.
Second, we include actions such as 'issuing', 'advising', and 'warning'
as organisational response information when the organisation is
positioned as 'doing' the action (e.g., 'The Shasta County Sheriff's Office
has issued an evacuation warning due to the Fawn fire'; Public
Broadcast System Warning, Alert, and Response Network, 2021a ).
These messages reflect strategic choices in phrasing to identify who isresponsible for a warning and position the organisation as playing adirect role in addressing a hazard or attempting to mitigate hazard
impacts but do not clearly direct individuals to take a specific protective
action. By identifying themselves as the source of an evacuation, order,or warning, organisations demonstrate that they are exercising due
diligence to warn of an impending threat and potentially fulfil legal
obligations to provide timely warnings and effective protectiveguidance. However, terms such as 'urging', 'asking', 'reporting', and
'reminding' were not included in our c onceptualisation of organisational
response information, as such phrasi ng primarily serves to identify the
source of the advisory and does not hold the same legal implication as
terms like 'ordering' or 'issuing'.
Additionally, inclusion of organisational response information
was coded only when response activities were distinct from thehazard itself. For example, several law enforcement ‐related hazardssuch as 'police activity' imply official action to address some hazard
(e.g., 'Avoid area at and near Southlake Mall on US 30 —Police
Activity'; Public Broadcast System Warning, Alert, and Response
Network, 2021c ). This statement implies an official response to some
hazard; however, if the hazard was not explicitly named in themessage, these WEAs were not coded as including organisational
response information because 'police activity' is presumed to be the
hazard. Another example is a 90 ‐character WEA that states 'Xcel will
be conducting rolling blackouts' (Public Broadcast System Warning,Alert, and Response Network, 2021d ). The 360 ‐character version of
this message specifies that the blackouts were intentional to mitigate
threats from a nearby wildfire, but without that knowledge theblackouts arethe hazard instead of a response to address or mitigate
the hazard.
Three other pieces of information were considered in this
analysis: inclusion of instructing information or guidance, message
length, and hazard type. Instructing information or guidance was
coded as present when WEAs contained explicit instruction toreceivers to take action in response to the hazard (e.g., 'take
shelter', 'check local media', 'call 9 ‐1‐1 if spotted'). Message length
(90‐or 360 ‐characters) was included in the data set as metadata for
each WEA; hazard type was coded manually to align with categoriesfrom Sutton, Wood, et al. ( 2023 ; see Table 2).

2.3 |Coding process
Contents were manually coded using Excel spreadsheets. Each
message was read as a single unit of observation. The WRM contents
and adjusting and instructing information were coded dichotomouslyas present or absent in each message. Intercoder reliability for
protective action guidance (i.e., instructing information) was performed
by the first author and a research assistant on the entire WEA data setprovided by FEMA ( n= 7645). We used 300 messages that were
randomly selected for intercoder reliability (Lombard et al., 2002 ),
including 50 messages used for pilot coding (Neuendorf, 2017 ).
Reliability was calculated using ReCal2 (Freelon, 2013 ) and was high
(α= .96); the research assistant coded the remainder of the sample.
Intercoder reliability for adjusting information was performed
later in a separate process, looking solely at messages sent between2019 and 2022 ( n= 4777), but followed a similar procedure. The first
and second authors first reviewed and refined the inclusion and
exclusion criteria for organisational response information beforeconducting two rounds of pilot coding with 50 messages each.
Agreement was satisfactory after the second round of pilot coding.
The coders proceeded to code 300 messages (Lombard et al., 2002 ),
including the 50 messages from the second round of pilot coding;Neuendorf, 2017 ) and reached high reliability ( α= .96) calculated
using ReCal2 (Freelon, 2013 ). The first author coded the remainder of
the sample, referring to the second coder for a second opinion whennecessary.
2.4 |Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to identify differences in the
inclusion of instructing and adjusting information, between 90 ‐and
360 ‐character messages, and between hazard categories. We
conducted additional chi ‐square tests to determine if differences in
use were statistically significant.
3|RESULTS
3.1 |Use and types of adjusting information
Instructing information was included in 72.2% of WEAs ( n= 3450).
Adjusting information was included in 13.7% ( n= 656) of WEAs.Additionally, 8.8% of the sample ( n= 419) included both instructing
and adjusting information. Three categories of adjusting informationwere included: mental health resources, official orders, and official
actions. The first category, mental health resources, includes the
conceptualisation of adjusting information as emotional coping andmental health resource information (e.g., Liu et al., 2020 ), and was
observed in 0.1% of the sample ( n= 4). The content of these four
messages was nearly identical and were all sent by the same AA forthe same hazard.
The second and third categories represent two forms of
organisational response efforts: orders and actions. Language
that described an official org anisation as issuing an order or
advisory was observed in 9.0% ( n= 432) of WEAs. Language that
described an official organisation's physical response to the
hazard was observed in 4.6% ( n= 221) of WEAs. One message in
our sample included details of both an organisational order and
action. Examples of messages from each of these three categories
are provided in Table 3.
3.2 |Differences by message length
Of the total sample ( N= 4777), 60.8% ( n= 2904) were 90 ‐character
WEAs and 39.2% ( n= 1873) were 360 ‐character WEAs. Instructing
information was included in 62.0% ( n= 1801) of 90 ‐character
messages and 88.0% ( n= 1649) of 360 ‐character messages. This
difference was significant ( χ2(1) = 384.329, p< .001, phi = 0.284),
with 360 ‐character messages being more likely to include instructing
information.
Adjusting information was observed in 7.1% ( n=2 0 6 ) o f 9 0 ‐
character messages and 24.0% ( n=4 5 0 ) o f 3 6 0 ‐character messages.
There was a significant difference for inclusion of adjusting informa-tion between 90 ‐and 360 ‐character messages ( χ
2(1) = 275.548,
p< .001, phi = 0.240), whereby 360 ‐character messages were more
likely to include adjusting information. Results are summarized inFigure 1.
3.3 |Differences by hazard type
Next, we assessed differences in inclusion of instructing and adjusting
information between WEAs sent for different hazards. We find that
public safety WEAs most frequently included instructing information

adjusting information least frequently. Results are summarized inTable 5.4|DISCUSSION
In this content analysis of 4777 WEAs sent between 2019 and 2022, we
find that approximately 72% of messages included protective action
guidance, which, in this analysis, represents contents that reflectinstructing information; this practice is supported by message design
frameworks from both risk (WRM; Mileti & Sorensen, 1990 )a n dc r i s i s
(SCCT; Coombs, 2007 ) communication scholarshi p. Additionally, 13.7% of
WEAs included adjusting information —or information to help receivers
psychologically cope. Although this practice is not recommended by the
WRM, it is recommended by SCCT to help receivers psychologically copewith the crisis. Approximately 9% of WEAs included both instructing and
adjusting information.
In response to RQ2, our analysis also identified three forms of
adjusting information present in these WEAs: (a) providing mentalhealth resources, (b) describing organisational actions in response to
the hazard, and (c) describing organisational orders to mitigate threats
associated with the hazard. The latter two represent what we call'organisational response information'. Thus, we expand the definition
of adjusting information applied by Liu et al. ( 2020 ), which focused
only on mental health resources and coping advice, and argue thatinformation regarding organisational efforts to address the current
crisis and reduce harm also functions as adjusting information. In
doing so, we extend the work of Coombs ( 2007 ), Liu et al. ( 2020 ), and
Page ( 2020 ) to determine how organisations include adjusting
information in WEA messages. Future research may show that
establishing that an organisation is actively involved in hazard
response at the start of the warning period may help to soothe theconcerns of the public, 'resolving [stressors the audience is
experiencing and responding to] through strategic communication
that ultimately maintains and builds credibility for the communicatoror organisation' (Veil et al., 2008 , pp. 28 –29). Indeed, crises

inherently hold some degree of uncertainty, but explaining the
corrective actions being taken to address the crisis can help to reduce
psychological stress caused by this uncertainty (Sellnow et al., 1998 ).
Additionally, including organisational response information may
serve to manage an organisation's reputation. From an SCCT
perspective, reputation threats stem from how the public viewswho is responsible for the crisis (Page, 2019 ). Organisations can
communicate their response actions to help establish organisa-
tional 'presence', such as actively detecting, monitoring, respondingto, and communicating about an unfolding event (Helsloot &Groenendaal, 2017 ;L i ue ta l . , 2020 ). Establishing presence can also
help to avoid negative public perceptions of organisational
credibility (Liu et al., 2020 ). This information helps to frame the
responding organisation as a competent responder and manager
that engages in socially standardized rituals associated with
leadership in times of crisis (Helsloot & Groenendaal, 2017 ). These
principles have not yet been evaluated in the space of terse
messages such as WEAs but may provide valuable insight as to how
corrective actions typically associated with reputation managementcan affect risk communication outcomes.
In response to RQ3, our analysis also shows that the inclusion of
both instructing and adjusting information was significantly higher in360 ‐character WEAs than in 90 ‐character WEAs, indicating that AAs
are taking advantage of the expanded character count to include
additional detail in their messages about what their organisations are
doing. However, the appropriateness and urgency of including thisinformation in WEAs, which are intended to alert and warn publics of
imminent threats, remains questionable.
The effects of adjusting information may be more influential for
certain hazards, specifically those that are human ‐induced or require
official intervention to resolve. In response to RQ4, our analysisshows that adjusting information was most frequently observed in
law enforcement messages, in which officials were often described asactively responding to an ongoing threat. This information may be
included to reassure receivers that officers are doing their jobs and
the situation is being addressed. In some cases, such information maybe viewed less as an assurance and more as a statement of power and
control.
The benefits of adjusting information have been well ‐
demonstrated in crisis communic ation literature (e.g., Claeys
et al., 2022 ;P a g e , 2020 ); however, these studies use long ‐form
risk messages for long ‐fuse threats as their stimuli, including
some messages with visual comp onents. These messages cannot
be classified as terse messages for short ‐fuse imminent threats as
WEAs are and are not received by the public in the same ways.
Thus, until researchers can demonstrate the positive effects ofincluding adjusting information in WEAs on terse messaging
outcomes recommended by the WRM , including message under-
standing, believing, personalising, and deciding (see Mileti &Sorensen, 1990 ;W o o de ta l . , 2018 ) ,w es u g g e s tt h a tA A s
continue to adhere to warning messaging guidelines from the
WRM, which have been empirically supported in a variety ofhazard contexts (see Wood et al., 2015 ). This is especially
important when AAs must choose which contents to include in
character ‐constrained channels such as WEAs. Less than three ‐
quarters of the messages analysed in this study includedprotective action guidance, yet we know from prior work that
excluding instructing informat ion from WEAs can result in lower
message understanding and self ‐efficacy (Sutton et al., 2021 )a n d
delayed protective actions (Wood et al., 2018 ).
4.1 |Limitations and future research
Given that extant alert and warning literature has not previously
explored the presence of adjusting information in WEAs, there is awealth of future research opportunities. We have defined and
quantified the use and types of adjusting information in WEAs
historically, including organisational response information; however,the results of this content analysis do not provide any explanation
as to why AAs choose to include (or exclude) adjusting information
in WEAs. It would be worthwhile to conduct interviews and/orfocus groups with AAs to understand why they choose to include
(or exclude) adjusting information. Perhaps some AAs have been
trained as public information officers, thus aligning more with thegoals of crisis communication to fill informational needs (Veilet al., 2008 ), rather than to alert and warn publics with an emphasis
on protective action. Findings from such research could be used to
inform AA training materials to ensure that appropriate contents areprovided in WEAs.
Additionally, this study does not assess public responses to
WEAs that include adjusting information, leaving us to wonderwhether its inclusion affects protective action or organisational
reputation outcomes. In the month following the content analysisTABLE 5 Inclusion of adjusting information by hazard type.

study presented here, the research team conducted a public message
testing experiment to assess the effect of organisational responseinformation on outcomes related to the WRM and organisational
reputation. Results showed no significant effects of including
organisational response information on any measured outcomesacross five hazards (Sutton, 2023 ). Future work will investigate how
the type of hazard (e.g., natural hazards vs. human ‐induced) affects
public perceptions of adjusting information contained in WEAs.
Lastly, this study identified different forms of adjusting informa-
tion but did not assess forms of instructing information in WEAs.
Future studies should investigate the different forms of protec-
tive action guidance in terms of types of recommended actions(e.g., 'evacuate now' vs. 'check local media') and how explicit versus
implied those guidance instructions are (e.g., providing a link vs.
'Check for updates here:'). Additionally, some of the components ofthe WRM could be used to assess the level of detail used to describe
instructing information (e.g., if instructions to evacuate include the
location and time at which to evacuate).
5|CONCLUSION
This study represents a crucial step toward understanding how
principles of crisis communication are used in the context of alerts
and warnings for imminent threats, drawing from our presentknowledge of the use of instructing and adjusting information during
crises. We find that adjusting information in WEAs typically takes the
form of organisational response information detailing official effortsto address or mitigate threats to public safety; however, this
information was included in only 13.7% of WEAs in our sample.
Adjusting information was most frequently found in law enforcement messages and was significantly more likely to be included in360 ‐character WEAs compared to 90 ‐character WEAs, indicating
that AAs are taking advantage of less restrictive space limitations
to include additional detail about hazard incidents. Instructinginformation, which is recommended in both the WRM (Mileti
& Sorensen, 1990 ) and SCCT (Coombs, 2007 ), was present in the
large majority of WEAs overall.
Crisis communication theory (e.g., Coombs, 2007 ; Page, 2020 ;
Sellnow et al., 1998 ) suggests that adjusting information, including
details of corrective actions or explanations of crisis resolution, canreduce uncertainty for message receivers, thereby reducing psycho-
logical stress and improving their perceptions of the responding
organisation. However, when considering the length limitationsimposed on WEAs along with suggestions that adjusting informationshould be shared during recovery phases after a crisis and second to
instructing information (Coombs, 2015 ), the appropriateness of
including these details in WEAs remains questionable. Future workis required to determine whether any potential benefits of including
adjusting information in WEAs warrant dedicating limited characters
to that information and whether this information is more important inspecific hazard contexts.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
