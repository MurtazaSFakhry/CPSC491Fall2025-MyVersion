During an emergency, it is necessary to quickly disseminate messages to the public.
These communications often provide information about the emergency as well as
guidance or advice aimed at ensuring the safety of the population. Successful
emergency communication depends upon how rapidly and reliably a message can be
disseminated, but also on how people respond to the message that they receive. To
assist emergency planners tasked with developing message sets for future incidents,in this paper we report a systematic review of all studies that assessed the impact of
mobile telephone alerting systems on intended and actual behaviour, to identify
factors that affect their likely impact. We searched multiple databases and conferred
with topic experts, resulting in a total of 22 studies which met the inclusion criteria.
Our results indicate that limited data exist on how people respond to text ‐based
warning messages and that much of the data is poor quality, indicating a need for
more real ‐world studies.

1|INTRODUCTION
Major incidents and emergencies require a prompt public response to
reduce adverse outcomes. Providing fast, effective public communi-
cation about an emergency and how people should respond can be
essential to saving lives and reducing negative impacts on apopulation (Rubin et al., 2012 ). To achieve this, official agencies
have tested multiple ways of rapidly warning people of emergencies.
Several techniques such as the use of sirens, alarms and landline
telephones have been in existence for many years and can beeffective, but the amount of information that they can provide topeople is limited (Fakhruddin & Chivakidakarn, 2014 ). More recently,
the proliferation of mobile phones has provided a quick and reliable
way to disseminate more detailed advice, using cell broadcasting totarget messages to all phones within a specific location (Bean et al.,
2016 ). The use of mobile phone networks in this way has been
beneficial but poses new challenges to understand and overcome. Inparticular, the development and deployment of text ‐based warning
systems in recent years has outpaced research into the effectiveness
and potential limitations of the alert messages that they convey (Bean
et al., 2015 ; Gutteling et al., 2018 ; Wood et al., 2015 ). While the
speed with which messages are delivered to the public is crucial in an

emergency, the success of the messaging is also determined by
whether and how people act on the information that they receive(Lee et al., 2013 ; Sutton et al., 2014 ).
To make messages as effective as possible in guiding people to
take action, we need to understand numerous factors. What, forexample, is the best wording for each message? How many messages
should be sent in an incident? Are there specific criteria for what type
of incidents should trigger a message? These are empirical questions,for which evidence is required.
While some previous review work has investigated public alert
and warning systems, these have generally focussed on American
studies and have not solely investigated the impact of text ‐based
emergency alert messages on behaviour (Kuligowski & Doermann,
2018 ; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine,
2018 ; Sadiq et al., 2022 ). The current review is therefore unique, in
that it looks solely at the impact of emergency alert messages on
behaviour and includes studies regardless of geographic location. To
assist emergency planners tasked with developing message sets forfuture incidents, in this paper we report a systematic review of all
studies that assessed the impact of location ‐specific, text ‐based
mobile emergency alert messages on intended and actual behaviour,to identify factors that affect their likely impact.
2|METHODS
2.1 |Search strategies
We searched the following electronic databases from inception to
14th March 2022: Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Publons and Scopus.
Databases were searched for articles containing MeSH terms orkeywords relating to mobile alerting (e.g., ‘notification system ’,
‘mobile alert ’,‘public messaging ’), text messages (e.g., ‘SMS message ’,
‘text message ’) and a type of emergency event (e.g., ‘chemical spill ’,
‘tornado ’,‘swine flu ’,‘shooting ’). Full details of our searches are
available in Supporting Information Material. Reference sections of
any pertinent studies and reviews were also examined for further
potential references.
2.2 |Inclusion criteria
This review included studies if they were published in English (no
date restrictions), contained original research, related to an emer-gency (e.g., natural hazards, infectious disease outbreak, terrorism),studied the use of a location ‐specific mobile telephone alerting
system and included a direct measure of actual behaviour, or a direct
measure of how people report that they would behave in either a realor hypothetical situation involving the alerting system. Both qualita-
tive and quantitative studies were included. There are many studies
which investigate things such as the percentage of phones thatreceive an alert, but do not delve into the actual behavioural
response of the recipient. In this review we looked only at thosestudies that directly investigated how people responded to either
actual or hypothetical messages. Also excluded were those whichlooked at emergency alerts via social media or any medium other
than text ‐based mobile messages as responses to these information
channels may differ (Schultz et al., 2011 ). We also excluded studies
that contained only location data (e.g., from mobile phone data),
measuring where in space people were located rather than what they
were doing, as this data is not a direct measure of either intended oractual behaviour. We also excluded studies that used crowd densitymeasurements where social distancing within the crowd could not be
determined. Studies were also excluded if multiple types of
messaging channel were used and results not separated accordingto type.
2.3 |Study selection
All titles and abstracts were screened by the first author using
Endnote software to identify potentially eligible studies and record
decisions. A subset of 500 titles and abstracts were additionally
screened by a second reviewer (the second author) to ensure that theinclusion criteria were applied consistently and accurately. Full textswere then screened by the first author and shared with the last
author to resolve any uncertainties through discussion. A list of
related literature has been included in Supporting Information:Appendix 1, which details reasons for exclusion from the review.
2.4 |Data extraction and risk of bias
The first author extracted data from all the included studies using a
narrative synthesis approach. This method is an established way ofusing text to collate study findings in mixed systematic reviews
where a meta ‐analysis is not appropriate due to methodological and
statistical variability (Campbell et al., 2018 ). Study and participant
characteristics were noted, including study design, study populations,
sample size, type of emergency, mobile alert details and behavioural
outcomes.
Studies were assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods
Appraisal Tool (MMAT), which is designed to appraise the methodo-
logical quality of qualitative research, randomised controlled trials,nonrandomised studies, quantitative descriptive studies, and mixed
methods studies (Hong et al., 2019 ).
3|RESULTS
3.1 |Search results
In total, 5703 titles or abstracts were identified and examined, from
which 53 articles were selected as potentially relevant to the review.Of these, 38 were excluded for not studying an emergency alert
(n= 11), not including a measure of behaviour ( n= 9), focusing solely2o f2 7 |MOWBRAY ET AL.

on evaluating the feasibility of the alert system ( n= 9), not conducting
original research ( n= 6), being a duplicate record of an already
included publication ( n= 2), and not being published in English ( n= 1).
This left a total of 15 studies which met the inclusion criteria (see
Figure 1PRISMA flowchart). Twenty ‐two studies that were not
previously included were flagged for inclusion during peer review.
When assessed, seven were deemed to meet the inclusion criteria,
bringing the full number of included studies to 22. Of these, four hada qualitative design. The other 18 studies used a variety ofquantitative methods including cross ‐sectional surveys ( n= 7), mixed
methods ( n= 5), and experimental design ( n= 6). The majority of
studies were conducted in the United States ( n= 14), but other
countries included the UK ( n= 3), South Korea ( n= 2), Canada ( n= 1),
China ( n= 1) and the Netherlands ( n= 1). A variety of behavioural
responses were measured by the studies, such as sharing ofinformation and following recommended behaviours, either reported
or intended.
3.2 |Quality of studies
The MMAT was used to rate the quality of each study. This tool
evaluates studies on five dimensions which vary based on studymethodology. To enable more detailed description of risk of bias inthe study, we scored studies out of two on each of the five
dimensions, resulting in a total score out of 10. To aid interpretation
of results, studies were rated as poor quality if they scored five orunder; moderate quality if they scored six or seven; and good quality
if they scored eight or over. Studies had a median score of 7, with a
range of 4 −9 (Figure 2). Overall, studies were of moderate quality, but

often lacked detail about aspects such as randomisation procedures,
confounding variables, or full outcome data.
3.3 |Qualitative studies
Table 1provides a summary of the qualitative studies that we
identified.
The first study aimed to understand how members of the
American general public interpret Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs)
and Twitter ‐length messages for a mock improvised nuclear device
detonation (Bean et al., 2016 ). Participants first took part in a think ‐
aloud telephone interview where they were asked to read and
respond to one of four potential alert messages. Two of the messageswere 90 ‐character WEAs and the other two messages were 140 ‐
character tweets. Subsequent to the interview, all participants took
part in a focus group where they examined two of the four mock
messages and discussed their understanding and beliefs about themessages, as well as perceived personal impact and intended
behavioural responses. Most participants felt that both the WEAs
and tweets lacked clarity and would have benefited from furtherinformation about the hazard, as well as greater details about the
protective action to be taken and the specific area that was affected.
Inclusion of a map helped participants to determine whether thehazard was impacting them specifically and belief in the message was
influenced by whether participants thought they had opted ‐in to
receiving alert messages. Overall, about a third of participantsreported the intention to take shelter immediately after receivingthe messages, although the 140 ‐character tweets were perhaps
slightly better at reducing milling behaviour. This could have been a
consequence of the longer message, or the way in which it wasworded.
A study conducted with Canadian university students in 2009,
focusing on three potential emergency situations which included atornado, a fire or a threatening message towards the university
(McGee & Gow, 2012 ). Focus group discussions examined howstudents living on campus might respond to an emergency alert about
one of the three scenarios. In the week before the focus groups,
participants met with researchers and were given three sealed
envelopes, each with the text of one SMS message relating to one ofthe emergency scenarios. Several days later they were sent a textmessage by the researchers telling them to open only one of the
envelopes and read the message inside. Each message provided
information about the emergency situation and protective behavioursthat participants should engage in (either sheltering in place or
leaving campus). Participants were asked to write down initial
thoughts and responses before attending a focus group where theydiscussed their experiences, understanding of the message and their
intended behavioural responses. Most students felt that the
emergency alert messages were easy to understand, but expresseduncertainty about how and where to evacuate, particularly inresponse to the unspecified threat. Belief in the messages was high
as participants were aware that the university had a warning system
in place, but most students reported that they would confirm theveracity of the message with friends, staff, or other sources before
acting. The protective behaviours that participants were asked to
consider were deemed to be feasible, but some participants reportedthat they would employ a ‘wait and see ’approach as they had
concerns about missing classes or exams.
A study, conducted with members of the general public in
America in 2014 aimed to examine how message sense making
supports individual risk processing and message interpretation
regarding tsunamis (Sutton & Woods, 2016 ). Participants took part
in focus groups where they were presented with a tsunami warningmessage. This message was taken from a real tsunami alert, with only
the date altered to match the focus group. Participants were asked to
imagine that they were on vacation in an area which has previouslyexperienced tsunamis, when the alert message appeared on their
phone. Participants tended to make sense of the messages by making
comparisons to media accounts they had seen of tsunamis, as well asdrawing on personal experiences with other hazard warnings,
particularly tornadoes. Participants generally expressed belief in theFIGURE 2 PRISMA 2020 flow diagram

message and this led them to take the intended protective action of
leaving the area, but many also explained that they would search forfurther information. Specifically, participants wanted more informa-
tion about specific affected locations to relieve their anxiety about
being in an unfamiliar place.
Another study, conducted in 2015 with UK teenagers sought to
identify factors that influence how young people might respond to
emergency text messages about flooding or an unexploded WorldWar Two bomb (Wong et al., 2018 ). Participants took part in a focus
group where they were shown two sets of four sample SMS
messages which gave them information about the emergency and
told them what to do. Participants then wrote down their initialthoughts, feelings and likely behavioural responses before engaging
in a group discussion. Intention to comply with advice was high, but
participants reported that they would be more likely to engage inrecommended protective behaviours if they were already familiar
with the alerting system, if the messages came from a trusted source,
if messages were only sent in serious events, if multiple messageswere sent and if the messages were short and formal in style.
3.4 |Quantitative and mixed methods studies
Table 2provides a summary of the quantitative and mixed methods
studies that we identified.
3.4.1 |Experimental design
In the single randomised controlled trial that we identified, the
researchers tested the effectiveness of SMS messaging to improveknowledge, attitudes and self ‐reported preventive behaviours about
influenza A/H1N1 (Chai et al., 2013 ). Using a single ‐blind method, a
random sample of community residents in China received 3 weeks of
either H1N1 prevention SMS messages, or tobacco cessation SMSmessages. Before messages were sent, participants completed a
survey collecting data about their demographics as well as
knowledge, attitudes and behaviours regarding H1N1 preventionand control. After a total of 10 SMS messages had been received
over a 3 ‐week period, participants completed another survey
containing the same measures, but also assessing acceptability ofthe SMS messaging system. Both study groups saw a significant
increase in self ‐reported engagement with recommended preventive
behaviours, however the H1N1 group was significantly more likely toreport having had an H1N1 vaccination post ‐SMS messaging.
Five further studies used an experimental design. The first study
sought to examine how the use of maps can clarify who should take
protective action in an emergency, and whether maps affect riskperception, intended action and trust in the message source (Cain
et al., 2021 ). Participants were American university students who
were randomised to either a school shooting or armed robberyincident. Participants initially answered a questionnaire to assess
their knowledge of campus emergency alerts. Then they wererandomised to a study condition and saw a message which either
provided text ‐only information about the type of hazard, location and
protective measures to be taken, or a message that provided the text,
plus a short or long distance map of the affected location. After
viewing the message participants completed questions about emo-tions, risk perceptions, crisis efficacy, behavioural intentions, message
understanding and trust. Participants in the school shooting scenario
had significantly higher responses across most measures, includingintentions to follow protective behaviours. Although those who wereexposed to a short distance map reported greater perceived risk
compared to participants who only received text based information,
the map had no significant effect on perceptions of risk severity,behavioural intentions, crisis efficacy, understanding or trust in
message source.
Another American university based experimental study aimed to
explore responses to text ‐only tornado warning messages compared
to messages which also incorporated warning polygons (very specific
locations affected by the alert) or radar images (Casteel & Downing,2016 ). University students were given information about WEAs and
were then told to imagine that they were on a trip and while driving,
received a tornado warning message. Messages were divided into 4categories which included text only, text and national weatherservice warning polygon, text and radar image, and text, warning
polygon and radar image. All participants initially completed two
practice warning messages before seeing all 26 study messages in acomputer randomized order. After each message they were asked
about risk perceptions and severity, as well as intentions to inform
loved ones about the incident. Results indicated that decisions toinform loved ones did not differ between types of warning message.
Including greater amounts of information also did not increase
perceptions of risk or severity.
A 2015 study explored which factors influence information
transmission when emergency messages describing various chemical
hazards are passed from person to person (Edworthy et al., 2015 ).
Five messages were passed along a chain of participants from the UKgeneral population using five modes of communication, including
SMS messaging, email, paper, phone and face ‐to‐face. Five groups of
10 participants each passed all five messages between them. Eachparticipant had to try to remember enough of the message to pass it
to the next participant while a researcher observed the process. In
the SMS condition, the message was sent directly to the phone of thefirst participant, and they then created and sent a text message to
pass the information on to the next participant. Written messages
were transmitted more accurately than verbal messages, with a paperformat being the most accurate, followed by SMS. Message accuracydeteriorated down the chain of participants. The researchers
suggested that written messages survive better as it is possible for
participants to reread them and take more time formulating their ownmessage. However, ‘location ’,‘advice ’and ‘substance ’(e.g., gas
release, chemical fertilizer, weak acid) survived well regardless of
communication channel.
Another study aimed to test how at ‐risk groups in the United
States respond to warning messages with and without maps (Liu8o f2 7 |MOWBRAY ET AL.

CI (1.02 −1.39)), with higher belief
predicting higher odds of alertingthe RA. For both Experiments 1and 2, experimental condition
was not a significant predictor of

suggests that behaviouralresponses, at least immediately

by emotional reaction and
publics' clarity of understanding
of the messages they receive.Clarity seems to be affected bypublics' technology access, butnot to the extent that emotion
impacts clarity. Additionally,
though information seekingconsistently contributesmeaningfully to information
sharing, information seeking also
is largely driven by emotionalresponses, with the impact ofmaps (as tested here) havinginsignificant effects.
Furthermore, information

et al., 2017 ). Hazard scenarios included tsunami, active shooter and
radiological disaster, with each participant randomised to a condition.In the first experiment, each of the three scenarios had messages of
90, 140 or 1380 character length, while the second experiment was
tsunami only and messages were 280 characters, plus a map.Participants viewed the mock phone message on a computer screen
and were then told to imagine how they would feel to receive the
message and answered questions about information seeking, emo-tion, compliance, decision clarity, information sharing behaviour andthe use of maps. Findings showed that maps did not change
understanding and potential compliance with protective behaviours
in this study.
The final experimental study was a simulated evacuation exercise
in the United States which sought to evaluate the effect of increasing
levels of detail in emergency SMS messages on underground miners'evacuation decisions (Rehman et al., 2020 ). Three emergency
scenarios had been developed which included a fire, a cave ‐in, or
an explosion. For each scenario there were four messages ofincreasing detail, and these were randomly sent either by SMS
message, or delivered in ‐person. Following each message, partici-
pants completed a survey to understand how they would react andwhat they would do in response to differing levels of detail in thealerts. The authors reported that the content of the messages had a
significant effect on miners' decisions, with more miners choosing to
evacuate when more detail about the incident was provided. Thechannel of communication did not significantly affect evacuation
decisions.
3.4.2 |Mixed methods
Five studies employed a mixed methods approach. The first was
conducted in 2018, shortly after the accidental release of a ballistic
missile warning message to the population of Hawaii (DeYoung et al.,
2019 ). The purpose of this study was to capture perceptions about
the warning message, protective actions taken and drivers of
protective actions. Members of the general population completed
an online survey which also contained open ‐ended questions.
Participants reported mixed beliefs about the veracity of the message
and seeking further information was common, though some
participants said they sought this information while simultaneouslytaking protective action. While many participants said they did not
take protective actions, some did say the event has led them to
prepare for taking action in the future.
An American study, focused on understanding how people
respond immediately after receiving emergency alert text messages
(Kim et al., 2019 ). Having arrived at the laboratory to take part in a
study described to be about multitasking, participants completed apretest assessing various psychological attributes, and then received
an unexpected warning message either about an active shooter or an
explosion. They were observed by the researcher for 1 min beforecompleting a post ‐test survey of their behavioural responses to the
warnings. Participants also took part in a qualitative interview abouttheir responses. Most participants did not react to the message at all,
and type of emergency was not a significant predictor of protectiveaction behaviour, though those who mainly spoke English at home
were more likely to engage in protective behaviour than those who
spoke only a language other than English at home. The qualitativeanalysis suggested that desensitisation to emergency alerts through
previous experience may reduce protective actions. The qualitative
work also found that participants might have been waiting forenvironmental or social cues before acting.
Another study of the accidental ballistic missile alert message
sent to the Hawaiian population was conducted several weeks after
the incident to capture the experiences of the population (Ling &Oppegaard, 2021 ). Similar to the earlier study, this was an online
survey which contained numerous open ‐ended questions for
members of the general public to complete. Belief in the veracityof the message was low, though many participants reported checking
the information with another media source or with close family and
friends. Some participants reported engaging in protective beha-viours such as staying home or sheltering until they had confirmed
whether the message was real.
A UK study looking at hypothetical flooding also used a mixed
methods approach to understand how members of the public wouldrespond to emergency SMS messages (Smith et al., 2022 ). Partici-
pants received SMS messages regarding a flood emergency and were
involved in a series of workshops where they collaborated in groupsto answer questions, complete tasks, and take part in a focus group.
Participants often talked about the need to check the veracity of the
messages. Those who had a past experience of flooding were twiceas likely to report preparing for evacuation if they received an SMS
(87% vs. 35%).
The final mixed methods study, based in the United States,
focused on the hypothetical explosion of an improvised nucleardevice (Wood et al., 2018 ). Four separate SMS messages were used,
providing different amounts of information. Each participant was
presented with one of the four randomly assigned messages and thenasked to complete a survey which collected data about their
understanding, beliefs, risk personalisation, how they would react
and milling behaviour intentions. Milling is a psychological processwhereby someone does not engage in a behaviour immediately as
they are checking the veracity of the message and seeing how others
will respond to a novel event. A smaller, separate group ofparticipants took part in telephone interviews or in ‐person focus
groups. Again, each interviewee or group saw only one randomly
assigned message. The combination of quantitative and qualitativedata suggested that messages with more information reduced theinclination to search for and confirm information, though they did not
eliminate the delay to action completely.
3.4.3 |Cross ‐sectional
Three cross ‐sectional studies focused on COVID ‐19 emergency
messaging. The first used an online survey to measure self ‐reported22 of 27 |MOWBRAY ET AL.
 14685973, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-5973.12499 by Be t - University of Mary Washington , Wiley Online Library on [19/02/2025].

changes in social distancing behaviour following a shelter ‐in‐place
SMS message (Elser et al., 2021 ). Participants were from the general
population and the researchers compared those living in the San
Francisco Bay area where the alert message took place, with those
living elsewhere in the United States. Participants in both locationsreported an increase in both their social distancing behaviour and
sheltering in place behaviour, though there was no significant
difference between the groups. Although this study focused on theBay area shelter ‐in‐place order, during the study time period, other
areas also issued similar orders making it difficult to determine the
effect of the messaging.
Another cross ‐sectional COVID ‐19 study surveyed members of the
general public in South Korea as well as a group of migratory workers to
assess how effective the government ‐driven SMS messages were for
public compliance with COVID ‐19 protective measures (Kim & Lee,
2021 ). Participants had all been rece iving regular messaging from the
national emergency SMS service regarding COVID ‐19 and protective
measures such as handwashing, coughing etiquette, mask wearing andthe reporting of symptoms. Each par ticipant completed a single survey
which captured self ‐report data about compliance with 30 different
behaviours. Participants with poor he alth status perceived SMS messages
as more helpful for complying with m easures and preventing infection
and had more positive attitudes to compliance than those with a better
health status. Differences between the general public and migratory
workers were minimal, though migra t o r yw o r k e r sw e r em o r el i k e l yt o
suggest that messages should be provided in English as not all migratory
workers spoke Korean and translation of messages was difficult.
The third cross ‐sectional study looking at COVID ‐19 also aimed
to determine the effectiveness of emergency SMS messages on
individual practice of COVID ‐19 protective behaviours (Lee & You,
2021 ). This online survey asked members of the general population in
South Korea to provide self ‐report data on the preventive behaviours
of mask wearing, hand hygiene and social distancing. Participants
who always read the SMS messages wore facial masks more, avoided
crowded places more, and cancelled or postponed social gatheringsmore frequently than those who did not always read the messages.
One cross sectional study focused on a potential nuclear
emergency, using an online survey to understand how participantsfelt about preincident communication, message preferences, adher-
ence, beliefs, risk perceptions and trust (Gauntlett, 2020 ). This study
was also able to ask participants about their behavioural response tothe accidental ballistic missile alert in Hawaii. Participants were
generally found to report high levels of adherence to the protective
alert telling people to ‘find shelter ’, though certain factors such as
being of mixed or other ethnicity, being outdoors when receiving themessage and believing an attack to be imminent were most likely to
impact adherence. Among those who did not take cover, key reasons
for nonadherence included fatalism, denial, unawareness anduncertainty.
Another study that looked at real emergency messages was a
telephone survey about SMS messages alerting the general popula-tion to large scale or industrial fires in the Netherlands (Gutteling
et al., 2018 ). Messages had been sent to everyone within a certaindistance of each fire and included requests to avoid areas, close
windows and doors and turn off ventilation systems. Participantswere randomly selected within 2 days of the messages being sent and
were asked about beliefs, reactions, information needs and beha-
viours. People were more likely to report engaging in protectivebehaviours when they rated their own affective reaction to reading
the message as higher (e.g., more anxious, concerned, angry), when
some social pressure was perceived and when the quality of themessage was perceived to be higher.
An online study assessed the use of health behaviour theory to
predict compliance to emergency text notifications across a wide
range of scenarios (Rogers et al., 2020 ). College students in the
United States were sent seven SMS messages, relating to different
emergency scenarios, such as the presence of an active shooter tohealth advisories. Messages gave brief information about the threatas well as protective behaviours such as sheltering in place, avoiding
certain areas or seeking healthcare. Following each message,
participants were asked to complete questions about their messagepreferences, perceptions and behavioural intentions. Most partici-
pants reported an intention to comply with the advice straight away
without verification, particularly in the active shooter scenario. Therewere some differences between scenarios, with perceived beha-vioural control being most important with rapid compliance to an air
quality alert scenario and higher response efficacy being associated
with rapid compliance in robbery, active shooter and fire scenarios.
Finally, a study of American college students tested the impact of
emergency text versus social media notifications on threat assess-
ments and behaviour (Sheldon, 2018 ). The scenarios were either an
active shooter or a tornado and for each scenario there were two
messages: one SMS and one social media. After participants had read
each message, they completed questions about the perceivedseverity of the incident and their intentions to share the messagesthat they had received. Text messages were perceived to be more
serious than warning messages sent through social media, though
there was no significant difference in terms of message sharing. Themore serious the message was perceived to be, the more likely it was
to be shared with others. However, those participants who had
experienced a tornado warning before were less likely to share thetornado warning message with those around them, and those who
had previously experienced a shooting warning were less likely to
share the shooting warning message.
4|DISCUSSION
During a major incident it is important that the public receive clear,
timely information about the threat as well as advice about
appropriate protective behaviours. Despite the speed with whichwarning messages can be sent, evidence we reviewed suggests that
many people do not react immediately to an emergency alert.
Instead, they often engage in ‘milling ’behaviour. This means they
spend time checking the message or interacting with others to
determine how to behave in unfamiliar circumstances —severalMOWBRAY ET AL. |23 of 27

studies in the papers we reviewed showed this effect (Bean et al.,
2016 ; Casteel & Downing, 2016 ; Kim et al., 2019 ; McGee & Gow,
2012 ; Rogers et al., 2020 ; Smith et al., 2022 ; Wong et al., 2018 ;
Wood et al., 2018 ). This corresponds well to evidence on ‘milling ’in
relation to other forms of emergency alert, which shows thatchecking the credibility of emergency messages is common (Wood
et al., 2018 ). Interestingly, studies of an emergency alert sent in error
indicated that although people sought further information to verifythe message, many also reported taking protective action at the sametime (DeYoung et al., 2019 ; Ling & Oppegaard, 2021 ), perhaps
highlighting a difference between hypothetical versus real ‐life
responses. Indeed, to reduce the negative impact of a major incident,there is a need to understand how we can encourage people to act on
a message as soon as possible and it is important to understand how
and when people seek further information and engage in protectivebehaviours.
From our review, there appear to be several factors that
influence the behavioural response to SMS alerts. These can becategorised as relating to the characteristics and past experiences of
the message recipient(s), the nature of the incident, or the features of
the message. First, behaviour can be influenced at an individual level.This includes specific factors such as the language spoken at homeversus in the message (Kim et al., 2019 ) and type of affective reaction
to the message (Gutteling et al., 2018 ; Ling & Oppegaard, 2021 ; Liu
et al., 2017 ). Several studies also determined that prior exposure to
warning messages was an important predictor of behavioural
engagement. In several studies, those who had received messages
previously either in a real incident or as a drill had potentially becomedesensitised to the warnings (Kim et al., 2019 ; Sheldon, 2018 ; Wong
et al., 2018 ), which aligns with previous studies showing that people
experience alert fatigue when numerous messages are received(Baseman et al., 2013 ; Lee et al., 2013 ; Perry et al., 2013 ). However,
one study did find that those who had prior experience of flooding
were twice as likely to report being prepared for evacuation
compared to those with no experience of flooding (Smith et al.,2022 ), while another reported that those who had previously
experienced a tornado warning were more likely to share a
subsequent alert message (Sheldon, 2018 ). Those who had received
the erroneous ballistic missile message also reported intentions to
prepare themselves for potential future incidents (DeYoung et al.,
2019 ; Ling & Oppegaard, 2021 ). In addition, a study of tsunami
messaging found that participants drew on personal experiences of
other hazards to inform their response to the existing message
(Sutton & Woods, 2016 ). Potentially, while alerts that are not
followed up by any particular impact on an individual result in adegree of desensitisation, incidents which do impact the individual
have the opposite effect.
Situational factors include the ‘milling ’behaviour discussed
earlier, but also the various environmental and social cues that can
influence how a person responds to an incident. Participants in some
studies described looking for visual or auditory cues that wouldconfirm the message and encourage them to engage in protective
behaviours (DeYoung et al., 2019 ; Gauntlett, 2020
; Kim et al., 2019 ;McGee & Gow, 2012 ). These cues were used by participants to
inform their own assessments about risk severity. Unsurprisingly,people who reported a more emotional reaction to the warning
message or greater perceptions that there is some societal pressure
to respond in a certain way were more likely to engage in protectivebehaviours (Gutteling et al., 2018 ; Liu et al., 2017 ; Wong et al., 2018 ),
in line with previous work (Rod et al., 2012 ). However, if perceived
threat or external pressures are too high, people seem inclined toavoid following warning messages (DeYoung et al., 2019 ; Gauntlett,
2020 ; Gutteling et al., 2018 ), perhaps practicing behavioural
avoidance as a coping mechanism (Witte & Allen, 2000 ). It is also
likely that perceptions of threat and emotional reactions will differ instudies asking people to imagine a potential future incident,
compared to studies asking them about a real ‐life incident which
they have experienced (Nordgren et al., 2011 ), thus highlighting the
need for more real ‐world studies in this area.
Finally, message characteristics also influence message credibility
and engagement with protective behaviours. Message style influ-enced behaviour, with more formal language making messages feel
more official and therefore more credible (Wong et al., 2018 ). In
addition, messages from an official, recognised source, such as agovernment agency, were more likely to elicit a behavioural response(Gutteling et al., 2018 ; McGee & Gow, 2012 ; Wong et al., 2018 ), as
suggested by previous research (Freberg, 2012 ; Kuligowski &
Doermann, 2018 ), while another study suggests that the order in
which information is presented can influence behaviour (Wood et al.,
2015 ). Though one study seemed to indicate that people generally
preferred short, simple messages (Wong et al., 2018 ), results from
other studies were mixed (Kim et al., 2019 ; Wood et al., 2018 ). Two
reported that milling behaviour was reduced among those who had
received longer, more detailed messages (Bean et al., 2016 ; Wood
et al., 2018 ), while another found no significant difference in
behavioural responses based on message length (Casteel & Downing,
2016 ; Kim et al., 2019 ; Liu et al., 2017 ). Studies which investigated
the inclusion of maps as additional information to help participantsmake sense of warning messages had mixed results with some finding
no significant effect on behaviour (Cain et al., 2021 ; Casteel &
Downing, 2016 ; Liu et al., 2017 ), though two did find that a map
resulted in higher levels of perceived risk susceptibility (Bean et al.,
2016 ; Cain et al., 2021 ). Therefore, it seems that there is a difficult
balancing act to be performed between providing short, succinctmessages, but also giving sufficient information for people to feel
confident in the message.
4.1 |Limitations
Several limitations should be considered for this systematic review.
First, our conclusions may be limited due to the paucity of available
literature. It is obvious from this review that plenty of scope exists for
future work to expand this literature and improve our understandingof behavioural responses to text ‐based warning messages. Second,
studies based on real ‐world incidents are needed, but it is also24 of 27 |MOWBRAY ET AL.
 14685973, 2024, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-5973.12499 by Be t - University of Mary Washington , Wiley Online Library on [19/02/2025].

important to note that the majority of studies conducted to date have
relied on self ‐reporting of behaviour. It is possible that self ‐report
may reflect actual behaviour, but it can also be heavily influenced by
numerous other factors, such as social desirability of reporting ‘good ’
behaviour and recall bias. In addition to self ‐report, most studies
measured behavioural intentions, or asked people what they would
do in a hypothetical incident, but this may differ to real ‐world
scenarios. Third, it is important to recognise that our review may beaffected by publication bias, whereby there is a tendency to publishonly those studies which demonstrate statistically significant results.
In reality, it is possible that additional research has been conducted to
explore our topic, but has gone unpublished as it has been deemed ofless interest or importance. Fourth, the studies included in our review
are heterogeneous in their characteristics such as study design,
location, population and type of emergency. Thus, it is key that wehighlight that our results may not be generalisable across these
domains.
While we made every attempt to search widely for relevant
studies across numerous databases, it is possible that we missed
some studies which used terminology relating to text ‐based mobile
alerting that were not included in our search. Finally, our searcheswere limited to English language papers, and it is possible thatresearch has been published on alerting systems in countries where
English is not the first language.
5|CONCLUSIONS
The findings from the systematic review align with those produced by
others, using an expert panel process (Sutton & Kuligowski, 2019 ).
Limited data exist on how people respond to text ‐based warning
messages and much of the data that does exist is poor quality. Toreduce the negative impact of major incidents, we need a better
understanding of the factors that affect behavioural responses to
such messages. In particular, we need more experimental studies andevaluations of the behavioural impact of warning messaging in real
world settings. For now, based on the results of the included studies,
several practical recommendations are posed for those consideringrolling out such systems. It is recommended that emergency planners
using mobile telephone alerting systems adhere to the following:
1. Provision of clear, actionable information as to what recipients
need to do when they receive an alert message, with clear
explanation regarding the effectiveness of the recommendedaction.
2. Specific details about the emergency (e.g., threat type and
location) should be included due to the role of risk perception
and perceived threat/urgency in adherence to alerts.
3. Accurate, consistent and timely information should be available
via other communication channels and alert messages should
signpost (e.g., a link or search recommendation) to furtherinformation to confirm message veracity or severity becauserecipients will likely seek further information from other sources
before deciding to take action.
4. A preincident public information campaign about the emergency
alert system should be delivered so that in the event of a major
incident, recipients are confident that the source is trustworthyand credible.
5. Alerts should be used infrequently and only when there is a real
need to inform the public about the messaging system or anincident to avoid desensitisation.
