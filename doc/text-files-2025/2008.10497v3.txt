ABSTRACT
During disasters, crisis, and emergencies the public relies on online
services provided by official authorities to receive timely alerts,
trustworthy information, and access to relief programs. It is there-
fore crucial for the authorities to reduce risks when accessing their
online services. This includes catering to secure identification of
service, secure resolution of name to network service, and content
security and privacy as a minimum base for trustworthy communi-
cation.
In this paper, we take a first look at Alerting Authorities (AA) in
the US and investigate security measures related to trustworthy and
secure communication. We study the domain namespace structure,
DNSSEC penetration, and web certificates. We introduce an integra-
tive threat model to better understand whether and how the online
presence and services of AAs are harmed. As an illustrative exam-
ple, we investigate 1,388 Alerting Authorities. We observe partial
heightened security relative to the global Internet trends, yet find
cause for concern as about 78% of service providers fail to deploy
measures of trustworthy service provision. Our analysis shows two
major shortcomings. First, how the DNS ecosystem is leveraged:
about 50% of organizations do not own their dedicated domain
names and are dependent on others, 55% opt for unrestricted-use
namespaces, which simplifies phishing, and less than 4% of unique
AA domain names are secured by DNSSEC, which can lead to DNS
poisoning and possibly to certificate misissuance. Second, how Web
PKI certificates are utilized: 15% of all hosts provide none or invalid
certificates, thus cannot cater to confidentiality and data integrity,
64% of the hosts provide domain validation certification that lack
any identity information, and shared certificates have gained on
popularity, which leads to fate-sharing and can be a cause for in-
stability.

1 INTRODUCTION
Online media have been proven to be an effective channel to com-
municate with the public. An ever growing number of Americans
prefer to get their news online [ 41], social media is being used for
public health announcements [ 87], and authorities provide pub-
lic disaster education and services via Web portals [ 33]—just to
mention a few examples. Communication of critical information
such as emergency response [ 10, Chapter 3] and provisioning of
critical services are no exception to this trend. Research shows that
in emergencies the public turns to official and authoritative sources
especially when specific, precise, and trustworthy information is re-
quested [ 20,24,29]. At the same time, evaluating the credibility and
trustworthines of online service providers during an emergency
or crisis poses a real challenge for users [ 59]. A recent example to
illustrate such situations is the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)
pandemic and its outbreak in the US in early 2020: with government
institutions and health authorities being perceived as the most (so-
cial media being the least) trustworthy sources of information by
the public [ 36,73], alone in the first month of the outbreak, nearly
half a billion visits were registered on websites of Centers for Dis-
eases Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) [ 3]. Similarly, the high amount of visits on state
unemployment websites brought the operation of many of those
sites to a halt [ 16]. The high demand for COVID-related online
services took place in parallel with an explosion of misinforma-
tion campaigns and fraudulent services. Despite efforts from top
tech companies [ 82] the overwhelming infodemic [91] continued to
grow and prevail [ 15]. This over-abundance of information posed
serious challenges both to politics and public health, and the grow-
ing number of individuals and business relying on unemploymentIf you cite this paper, please use the WWW reference: Pouyan Fotouhi Tehrani, Eric Osterweil, Jochen H. Schiller, Thomas C. Schmidt, and Matthias Wählisch. 2021.

insurance and governmental relief programs led to a boom in online
fraud [84] with many falling prey to such schemes.
In this paper, we address the research blind spot of trustwor-
thy and secure Web-based emergency services. We systematically
investigate the digital representation of emergency and disaster
management organizations in the U.S. through the lens of the Do-
main Name System (DNS), its Security Extensions (DNSSEC) [ 7–9],
andthe Web PKI (see Figure 1). Based on our threat model, we aim
to understand whether and how specific integration of these orga-
nizations in the domain namespace and their use of DNSSEC and
X.509 certificates can mitigate threats against trustworthy commu-
nication. The point of departure for our study is the list of Alerting
Authorities (AA) provided by FEMA [ 35], which comprises all enti-
ties (the US governmental and non-governmental organizations)
on federal, state, territorial, tribal, and local levels authorized to
dispatch alerts.
Our key finding shows that only about 22%, i.e.,291 out of a
total 1327 unique hosts, provide sufficient measures to ensure trust-
worthy identification. This decomposes as follow: ( i) only half the
investigated organizations are uniquely identifiable based on dedi-
cated domain names while the rise of multitenancy structures and
shared certificates throughout the past decade has complicated
identifications in general and has also led to an expansion of attack
surfaces [ 67], (ii) the majority of organizations ( ≈64%) do not take
advantage of restricted namespaces for better protection against
name spoofing and more than 96% of investigated DNS zones are
susceptible to DNS attacks due to lack of DNSSEC, and finally ( iii)
about 15% are exposed to content poisoning as a result of invalid
or no certificates. In more detail, in this paper we contribute:
(1)Threat model (Section 3) . We introduce a threat model
that integrates different characteristics of DNS and Web PKI
into groups of Assurances Profiles that qualifies various de-
grees of reachable security.
(2)Method (Section 4) . Our method identifies common public
Alerting Authorities in the US and corresponding websites.
The modular and configurable pipeline introduced here for
data collection and analysis maintains a certain level of gen-
erality which makes it suitable to be extended to non-US
regions in future work.(3)Analysis of namespace structure and protection (Sec-
tion 5) . We map names of Alerting Authorities to fully qual-
ified domain names (FQDN) and identify operational depen-
dencies. Usage of restricted and protected namespaces as
well as penetration of DNSSEC among AAs are investigated
in this section. We also studied whether there are discrepan-
cies between organizations from various fields of operation
(e.g.,governmental, military).
(4)Analysis of Web PKI (Section 6) We analyze Web PKI
certificates used to authenticate and identify Alerting Au-
thorities. On the one hand the historical and actual usage of
X.509 are studied, and on the other hand it is investigated
how widespread these technologies are, which certificate
authorities are leading the market among AAs, and how (au-
tomated) domain-validation certificates affect trustworthy
communication.
While prior work has investigated the deployment of security
protections broadly across different application domains, to the best
of our knowledge, this is the first paper that investigates the security
profiles of official critical (and critical-to-life) Alerting Authorities.
After presenting background and our results, we discuss improving
measures and conclude with an outlook.
2 BACKGROUND
Emergency management (EM) can be understood as an ongoing
cycle of mitigating, preparing for, responding to, and recovering
from incidents that threaten life, property, operations, or the envi-
ronment [ 11,13]. The core objectives of emergency management,
ranging from coordination efforts to raising awareness and critical
service provision, are carried out by governmental agencies, NGOs,
volunteer groups, and international organizations. The structure
and organization of these entities differ in each country and even
on local and regional levels. In the US, the list of Alerting Authori-
ties regularly published by FEMA [ 35] provides a non-exhaustive
overview of organizations which are (directly or indirectly) involved
in the process of emergency management.
In each phase of EM cycle, communication (between and among
authorities and the public) plays an integral role not just as a mere
necessity but also in amounting to social resilience [ 58]. Beside
using dedicated alerting systems, e.g., FEMA’s Integrated Public
Alert & Warning System [34], social media, or similar channels for
information dissemination, many involved organizations have their
own dedicated websites not only for informational purposes but
also for services such as volunteer registry or disaster aid applica-
tion ( e.g.,Homeland Security’s disasterassistance.gov ).
In this paper we investigate the namespace structure, DNSSEC
penetration, and deployment of Web PKI certificates among Alert-
ing Authorities to maintain secure communication (as defined in the
next section). The global domain name system (DNS), a distributed
key-value database with a hierarchical namespace and management
scheme, is de facto the entry point to many (if not all) of Internet
services. Respectively, for critical service providers, e.g.,Alerting
Authorities, it is indispensable to be represented within namespaces
protected both in organizational and technical terms: top-level do-
mains (TLD) with restricted naming and delegation policies protect
domain name owners against name and trademark violations whileMeasuring Namespaces, Web Certificates, and DNSSEC of AA WWW ’21, April 19–23, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia

assuring end users that the domain name owner has undergone
some form of vetting; at the same time, DNSSEC [ 7] compensates
the vulnerable client/server paradigm of DNS [ 12] and caters for
authenticated delegation and protect DNS data against tampering.
To authenticate the content provider behind a domain name X.509
certificates [ 26] are used. The semantics of a certificate depends
on its certification process: if the real-world entity behind a certifi-
cate is vetted by a certification authority (CA) and is respectively
awarded with an organization or extended validation certificate
(OV/EV), the certificate can used for identification. Otherwise, if
the validation is limited to the ownership of a domain name, i.e.,do-
main validation (DV), the certificate is only good for authenticated
confidentiality and integrity.
3 A THREAT MODEL FOR WEB-BASED
EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION
Emergency communication is dependent on heightened security
requirements which are not always as relevant for other Internet
services ( e.g.,video streaming, social media). Three steps constitute
our definition of secure online communication: ( i) securely authen-
ticating the authoritative service (“identification” of the person,
organization etc.behind the service name), ( ii) securely verifying
that users have not been misdirected and are transacting with the
service name they have identified (“resolution” of name to network
service), and ( iii) ensuring that the content was not altered, leaks
privacy etc.during the session (“transaction” security). Although
different methods can be utilized to realize such a secure workflow,
here we focus on those technologies that are most accessible to
(and deployable by) users and service operators in today’s Internet,
namely the DNS and the Web PKI ecosystems. Alternative solutions
are discussed in Section 8.
An illustrative example. For illustration of the communication
workflow and respective security pitfalls, we consider the simple
case of inquiring information about COVID-19 guidance as a resi-
dent of Jackson County in Missouri. Through a search engine, an
online ad, a recommendation from friends, etc.the URL is quicklydiscovered: https://jacohd.org . When visiting the website, the
presence of a green padlock in the address bar indicates only the
confidentiality and integrity of data exchange, but does not indicate
whether the website belongs to the supposed service ( i.e.,Health
Department of Jackson County in Missouri instead of one of the
other 22 Jackson Counties). The generic domain name could haven
been registered and operated by anyone. An attacker could have
published a forged website implementing the look and feel of the
real health department. At no stage is the user given the chance to
authenticate the identity ( i.e.,identification) of the service provider
because the provided DV certificate does not include any identifi-
cation information. In contrast, the health department of Jackson
County in Michigan is reachable under www.co.jackson.mi.us1.
Here, the domain name under a restricted TLD indicates that it
belongs to Jackson County ( co.jackson ) in Michigan ( mi.us ), and
the accompanying EV certificate serves as a definitive proof of
identity.
Threaten identification. In a secure setting, it would be possi-
ble to identify and authenticate the communication partner before
initiating the transaction. Yet, the point of departure for Web com-
munication are domain names, which cannot be used for secure
identification, while Web PKI certificates (as proofs of identity) are
provided only after resolution succeeds and transaction is initiated.
This implies that targeting authentic names and subsequent secure
resolution are necessary (yet insufficient) conditions of identifi-
cation through a certificate. Respectively, simple name spoofing,
e.g.,through typosquatting [ 51], DNS cache poisoning [ 90], or other
DNS hijacking attacks, which can mislead users to malicious ser-
vices, can act as a precursor for impersonation attacks, especially if
subsequently only a DV certificate with no identity information is
presented. A viable countermeasure is the use of restricted names-
paces so at least the affiliation or identity of the service provider
can be inferred directly from its respective name. Governmental
organizations in the US, for example, educate visitors that domain
names of federal government agencies most commonly end in .gov

or.mil . Subsequently, an OV/EV certificate provides direct ele-
ments of proof of identity. When considering using approaches like
this, exceptions may serve to help prove the rule: consider that the
United States Post Office’s (USPO’s) official website is uspo. com ,
i.e.,not under .gov . This, then, necessitates additional knowledge
or verification before users of that government agency can be as-
sured that they are transacting with the official authority online.
Proper identification, thus, involves both selection of proper do-
main names, secure resolution (see below), and identity information
from OV/EV certificate.
Threaten resolution. The second attack surface pertains to name
resolution. There are two methods to assert that a name has been
resolved correctly: either by using DNSSEC or through the X.509
bindings in a certificate’s common name (CN) or subject alternative
names (SAN). The latter approach, however, provides only an a pos-
teriori assurance, i.e.,after transaction initiation with a server, and
only if the resolution has already succeeded correctly. Furthermore,
especially in case of DV certificates, if resolution is compromised,
e.g.,through DNS poisoning, and as a result attackers were granted
a DV certificate (see Brandt et al. [14]), there is no way to verify
the integrity of the resolution process. The only effective solution
in securing name resolution and deterring collateral damages such
as DV certificate misissuances is deployment of DNSSEC.
Threaten transaction. In the final step, after name identification
and resolution, it is imperative to secure the transaction using
transport security protocols (TLS/SSL) in terms of authenticated
confidentiality and integrity. It is worth noting that authentication
(using X.509 certificates) is crucial, because encryption and integrity
checks alone can also be performed by a malicious actor using
monkey-in-the-middle attacks.
Assurance profiles. Based on threats on the three aforementioned
dimensions, Table 1 provides the various combinations of DNS and
Web PKI options and the security implications of their deployment
for users; the Assurance Profiles summarizes their combinations.
To achieve strong assurance , a service provider should own a do-
main name that ( i) indicates its affiliation, ( ii) is securely delegated,
and ( iii) is bound with a real-world entity through an OV/EV certifi-
cate. A prominent example is coronavirus.gov which is registered
under .gov TLD denoting it being a governmental domain name,
supports DNSSEC ( i.e.,cannot be hijacked), and provides a valid
OV certificate belonging to the Executive Office of the President .A service provider that only partially covers these aspects and
fails to deploy DNSSEC or uses a name under a non-restricted
namespace exhibits a weak Assurance Profile due to susceptibility
to DNS hijacking or simple name spoofing. This is how a campaign
in Germany was able to defraud up to 4000 applicants of the corona
relief program of a federal state. The scammers spoofed the orig-
inal domain name soforthilfe-corona.nrw.de by registering
nrw-corona-soforthilfe.de without much burden because the
.deTLD has no delegation restrictions that cannot be circumvented
with minimal effort. Although the authentic name (the former) was
bound to a valid OV certificate, the spoofed name was awarded
with a DV certificate which gave the impression of authenticity
and caused users to fell prey to this phishing campaign. Similarly,
the threat of DNS hijacking was highlighted during the pandemic
as attackers managed to exploit a vulnerability in home routers
and made use of insecure DNS to manipulate name resolution; an
attack which could easily be defended through DNSSEC.
In contrast to the previous cases, inadequate assurance reflects
the case when no certificate or only a DV certificate is provided
regardless of domain name properties and presence of DNSSEC.
Lack of a certificate at the very least defeats the purpose of au-
thenticated encryption and integrity verification2, while a mere
DV certificate can at best only cater to confidentiality and integrity
without providing any information about the identity of service
provider. An example of weak assurance is the Corona Emergency
Response Fund of CDC foundation under give4cdcf.org which
have raised millions of dollars in fighting the pandemic. The usage
of.org generic TLD simplifies name spoofing3, lack of DNSSEC
make it a suitable target for hijacking, and finally the provided DV
certificate practically doesn’t provide any evidence of identity.
4 METHOD AND DATA CORPUS
The subject of study in this paper are the US organizations involved
in EM. Due to lack of a central registry, we focus on the list of Alert-
ing Authorities maintained by FEMA. Although this list might not
include each and every entity involved in emergency management,
it provides a decent, legitimate overview over this field comprising
a wide spectrum of organizations ranging from local governments,
law enforcement agencies, and military bases to NGOs and universi-
ties. Each entry represents an organization by a unique ID, a name,

are not scalable and suitable for studied cases here.

and a territory of operation (including unincorporated territories).
Throughout this study, we use the AA list from September 11, 2019
comprising 1,388 entries (excluding a single duplicate entry).
Our method consists of three phases: (1) preparation phase, (2)
domain namespace analysis, and (3) Web PKI analysis. Our mea-
surements were carried out from October 2019 up to March 2020
with each measurement being executed at least twice from vari-
ous vantage points in Europe and the US to detect any possible
vantage point dependent discrepancies, e.g.,limited access due to
geo-blocking. Figure 2 summarizes our methodology from prepara-
tion phase to data gathering and final analysis (see § 5 and § 6).
(1) Preparation. In the preparation phase, we first retrieve and
parse the AA list and assign the domain name used for web services
for each organization. To identify the primary website of an Alerting
Authority, we query and scrape the Google search engine. For each
entry in the AA list, the combination of name and territory of
operation ( e.g., Fresno Police Department CA ) was used as query
string. Each query yielded between 4 and 12 results. Since the
results are not necessarily ranked to have the official URL first, we
excluded results based on a list of inapt domain names ( e.g.,social
media sites and yellow pages). The topmost remaining URL was
then selected for the respective organization. Finally, the list of
collected URLs was manually checked to remove any mismatches
and falsely associated URLs which were not detected automatically,
e.g.,same URL for homonymous counties in different states. A total
of23entries were removed: 11entries with mismatched names,
11associated with the wrong territory of operation, and 1with
no matching URL at all; leaving a total of 1,365URLs for further
analysis. The remaining URLs ( e.g., https://www.fresno.gov/
police ) were parsed to extract the FQDNs ( e.g.,www.fresno.gov )
and path segments ( e.g.,/police ).
(2) Domain Namespace Analysis. In the second phase we first
separate effective second-level domains (SLD) from TLDs, e.g.,for
‘www.ci.tracy.ca.us ’, ‘ca.us ’ being the TLD (more specifically
the public suffix) and ‘ tracy ’ the effective SLD. We then checkDNSSEC status for both the given domain name and its TLD, cate-
gorize TLDs (restricted/unrestricted), and finally, based on a list of
predefined keywords (see Table A.I in Appendix) map each Alerting
Authority to a field of activity as either Public safety, Governmen-
tal, Law enforcement, Military, or Educational. The results of our
analysis on domains names is presented in Section 5.
(3) Web PKI Analysis. Finally, domain names were used to inves-
tigate the current and historic adaption of Web PKI certificates by
respective hosts. To study the current state, OpenSSL version 1.1.
1dCLI was leveraged to fetch complete certificate chains, perform
validation, and verify revocation status using stapled Online Certifi-
cate Status Protocol (OCSP) [ 1], manual OCSP [ 78], or Certificate
Revocation Lists (CRL) [ 26] (depending on availability). For our his-
torical analysis, we used CT logs [ 55,79]. To do this we leveraged
the publicly accessible database provided by Sectigo under crt.sh,
which audits 79 log servers from 12 organizations (at the time of
writing). For any given host name, the database was queried for
certificates which have the host name or a wildcard covering the
host name as their subject name or have it included in the list of
subject alternative names (SAN). From a total of 28 ,370retrieved
unique certificates, 10 ,826were pre-certificates and are omitted
from further analysis. The remaining 17 ,544certificates were then
limited to those issued in the past decade (2009-2019), leaving a
total number of 17 ,477certificates which are analyzed as described
in Section 6.
5 DNS NAMESPACE ANALYSIS
By studying the domain names of alerting authorities, we aim to
answer the following questions:
(1) Does each AA have its own dedicated domain name?
(2) How do AAs integrate in the global DNS namespace?
(3) Do AAs secure their names using DNSSEC?
The first question is concerned with how Alerting Authorities main-
tain their online presence, and avoid unnecessary dependencies.
Lack of a dedicated name, for example, leads to dependence onWWW ’21, April 19–23, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia Tehrani et al.
someone else for authentication and data security as X.509 certifi-
cates are bound to domain names. The second question aims to
investigate whether AAs prefer specific TLDs to take advantages of
recognizability ( e.g.,governmental organization under .gov ) and
security (restricted vs. non-restricted TLDs). Finally, the last ques-
tion regards measures taken in securing names against threats such
as spoofing or DNS hijacking which can also lead to impersonation
and phishing. Table 2 summarizes our findings.
5.1 Dedicated Domain Names
We consider an AA to have a dedicated DNS name either if it has
its own effective SLD, or has been assigned a sub-domain under
the namespace of its parenting organization or any generic service
provider, which is not shared. For example, the Tehama County Sher-
iff(tehamaso.org ) has its own dedicated name whereas Apache
County Sheriffs Office (www.co.apache.az.us/sheriff/ ) does not.
To measure dedicated domain names we divided the set of AA
URLs into two groups depending on whether the URL path segment
is empty (674 entries) or not (691 entries); the group with empty
path segments was then regarded as having dedicated names. To
prevent false positives of non-dedicated names, we manually ex-
amined all these websites and verified that the landing page does
not relate to the Alerting Authority. We found only 25 false pos-
itives ( e.g., http://www.franklincountyema.org/db/ with /db
path being the start page), which leads to overall ≈51% AAs with
dedicated names while the rest represents common names of parent
organizations or other service providers. We also observed three
emergency management agencies with dedicated names which are
redirected (using HTTP 301/302 response codes) to web pages un-
der county or state websites. Out of the total 1,365 collected URLs
1,327 unique domain names exist, showing that in some cases mul-
tiple entities are subsumed under the same domain, e.g.,different
agencies all under the domain name of a single state.
The data also shows that all educational entities (total of 4) and
over 90% of governmental entities (467 out of 503) such as state
and local governments own dedicated names in contrast to only
≈25% of public safety entities (164 out of 669), and less than half of
military organizations (8 out of 19) which nearly all are represented
under home.army.mil .
5.2 Namespace Structure
We start with various TLDs and country code second-level domains
(ccSLDs) in use by Alerting Authorities, which we group as follows:
gTLD [48]: generic top-level domain, e.g.,.org

ccSLD [49]: country code second-level domain, e.g.,.ny.us
sTLD [50]: sponsored top-level domain, e.g.,.mil
Each TLD group features different properties. In general, there are
little to no delegation limits and naming conventions for names
under gTLDs or ccTLDs except for the .usnamespace. Under .us
ccTLD more than 3,000 names are reserved and unavailable for pub-
lic registration [ 61] and the namespace has a rigorous structure with
domain names at second, third, or fourth levels. This structuring
reflects the “political geography” [ 25] and defines a number of re-
served names for designated organizations or purposes, e.g.,county
or city, and territory of operation [ 25,62]. Finally, sponsored TLDs

(.edu ,.gov , and .mil ) impose stricter eligibility requirements and
thus have an advantage over gTLD names so that it can be made
sure that only eligible registrants are granted the ownership of
respective domain names [ 31,71], given that such policies are ade-
quately enforced by respective registries.
As summarized in Table 2, whereas half of domain names are
registered under generic TLDs, the remaining majority ( ≈45%)
makes use of sponsored TLDs and names within the .usstate-
code namespace, and the rest 5 percent opts for domains under
ccTLDs. It is noteworthy that the .uslocality namespace exhibits
a relatively low penetration among AAs. For example, the usage
of canonical forms [ci,co].<locality>.<state-code>.us for
cities or counties: we observe that for every 5 cities which have the
term cityin their domain names there exists only 1 city which uses
the foreseen naming pattern, and for every 4 counties choosing to
have the term county in its domain name, there is only one county
opting for the canonical form.
Finally, we examined if the specific choice of top-level domains
for an organization correlates with the organization’s field of opera-
tion. Figure 3 depicts how widespread various TLD types are in use
in different fields of operation. It is noteworthy that educational
and military organizations make exclusive use of restricted TLDs
(.edu and .mil respectively), whereas gTLDs remain the more
popular choice among the others. This figure also confirms the
previous observations that the majority of remaining organizations,
regardless of field of operation, opt for generic TLDs instead of
taking advantage of special namespaces within the well-organized
structured of .usnamespace.
5.3 DNSSEC Deployment
We used drill to chase DNS signatures and verify if a domain has
properly activated DNSSEC. All TLDs in use by AAs (see Table 2)
support DNSSEC except a number of .usccSLD domains: out of 50
total state ccSLDs under .usnamespace, 32 have been used by AA
organizations with only 18 supporting DNSSEC. Figure 4 depicts the
state ccSLDs, which support DNSSEC (blue), which do not support

longitudinal DNSSEC study of Chung et al. [ 22], measuring 0.6%
for.com and 1.0%for.org domains, we observe a higher DNSSEC
penetration. However, to our surprise even among .gov SLDs which
are mandated to implement DNSSEC [ 66] less than 10% (30) have
support for DNSSEC which is considerably less than the ≈90%
DNSSEC penetration among select governmental organizations
(sample set of ca. 1200 .gov SLDs) as measured by NIST [63].
6 WEB PKI ANALYSIS
The ecosystem of Web PKI revolves around X.509 certificates. We
investigate the deployment and characteristics of certificates in the
context of Alerting Authorities to answer the following questions:
(1) To what extent do AAs adapt web PKI?
(2)How is the historic landscape of X.509 shaped among AAs?
6.1 Current Deployment of Certificates
To have a better understanding of the current deployment of web
certificates, we gathered a snapshot of SSL/TLS deployment on
public servers of Alerting Authorities.
Out of the total 1327 unique names, 1187 hosts ( ≈89%) support
SSL/TLS with 1130 hosts ( ≈95%) delivering valid X.509 certificates.
Within the remaining 57 hosts, 17 use expired certificates, 9 use self-
signed certificates, and 1 has self-signed certificates in its certificate
chain. The validity of certificates provided by the remaining 30 hosts
could not be verified due to some kind of misconfiguration, e.g.,use
of invalid certificates or certificates with missing issuer information.
Recall that we use OpenSSL trusted root certificates for validation.
Compared with other Web PKI studies we see in our focused sample
of AA organizations relatively less invalid certificates compared
to global average of 65%as observed by Chung et al. [ 21] over the
IPv4 space in 2016, or ≈13%as measured by Durumeric et al. [ 28]
for Alexa 1M top domain list in 2013.Table 4: Validation types and assurance profiles per sector

Table 3 combines our findings from this Section and Section 5 to
reveal different combinations of DNS and X.509 certificate charac-
teristics, linked to different levels of assurance according to Table 1.
In Table 4, we group our results by organization types. Due to low
penetration of DNSSEC, popularity of open TLDs, and pervasive-
ness of DV certificates among AAs (§ 5), only about 22% of AA are
considered to be equipped against common threats to trustworthy
communication.
6.2 Historic X.509 Certificate Landscape
The historic analysis of X.509 certificates collected from Certificate
Transparency logs (see Section 4) helps us to gain a better under-
standing of security policy changes related to Alerting Authorities
and CAs. We span ten years. It should be noted that the total num-
ber of organizations with publicly logged certificates changes for
each year. We consider this in the following and normalize the
results either with respect to the number of organizations or total
number of certificates valid per year.
6.2.1 Certificate Authorities. In addition to common regulations,
certificate authorities implement and follow their own set of policies.
From the perspective of relying parties, i.e.,web users, such policies
are opaque and as long as a CA is included in a user’s trust store,
it is considered trustworthy. For the subscribers, however, these
policies among other factors such as fees, offered certificate types,
and operation costs are decisive in choosing an appropriate CA.
We focus our analysis on the list of top CAs with an average
coverage of yearly 20 unique AA subscribers (hosts) in the last
decade. We use the term cover to differentiate from issuance: if a
host, for example, is issued a certificate by a CA valid from 2010 to
2013, we consider this host to be covered by that CA for 2010, 2011,
2012, and 2013. Respectively, if a CA issues multiple short-lived
certificates ( e.g.,90 days) for a host within a given year, we only
count that host as covered once in that year by the issuing CA. This
would avoid the data skew in favor of issuers with lower certificate
validity windows and higher certification rate per year. It also
should be noted that a single host can have certificates issued from
different CAs. Figure 5 depicts these findings in terms of relative
market share development in the past decade (see Table A.II in
Appendix for details). Compared with the CA market share for the
Alexa 1M top domain list throughout the last last decade [ 2,28,45]
we observe parallels, such as decline of GoDaddy’s market share
and rapid gains of Let’s Encrypt, as well as discrepancies that cannot
directly be explained due to dynamic nature of and fluctuations in
the Alexa top list.WWW ’21, April 19–23, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia Tehrani et al.

Figure 6: Development of certificate types and assurance pro-
files (§3) in the past decade
Figure 5 also highlights two factors evidently decisive for AAs
in their choice of CA: convenience and cost factors. GoDaddy, for
example, which has been the market leader among AAs for about
two thirds of the past decade, provides web hosting and domain
name registration beside certification services in convenient pack-
ages; and Let’s Encrypt, which has surged to the top in the short
period after its public offering, offers automated DV certification at
no cost.
6.2.2 Validation types and assurance profiles. In Section 6.1, we
showed that currently only about 22% of AAs honor security profiles
that are resilient against threats to trustworthy communication (see
Tables 3 and 4). Historically, however, as depicted in Figure 6, a
higher share of alerting authorities provisioned for such measures.
When compared with the share of various certificate validation
types (DV, OV, and EV), it becomes evident how the decreasing
usage of OV certificates is directly proportional to the reduction of
preferred assurance profiles. At the same time the surging popu-
larity of DV certificates has led to an increase in cases of what we
consider as inadequately trustworthy (no identification). It should
be noted that as our partial historical DNSSEC penetration statis-
tics (collected through SecSpider4[67]), covering≈25%of studied
hosts, exhibits negligible fluctuation in DNSSEC penetration, we
made a simple assumption that historic support for DNSSEC among
AAs equals to its current penetration state (see Section 5.3).
6.2.3 Certificate Sharing. Except EV certificates, both DV and OV
certificates allow wildcard names as subject alternative names (SAN)

YearShare (%)DNS SAN (#) (10,50] (50,100] (100,)Figure 7: Share of host names represented by certificates
with more than 10 unique SAN entries
to avoid enumerating all FQDNs under the control of the certifi-
cate holder. In practice, the SAN extension also allows sharing a
certificate among different hosts. For example, In 2019 the federal
government was issued OV certificates with more than 600 SAN
entries each. Certificate sharing expands the attack surface and in-
creases operational costs since if one of the hosts is compromised or
the certificate is revoked, every other host also need to configured
with a new certificate (sometimes called “fate-sharing”).
Multitenancy web hosting and security service providers (both
public or government exclusive) are making use of shared certifi-
cates as depicted in Figure 7. It is worth noting that Let’s Encrypt
certificates only allow up to 100 DNS type SANs. In our analysis,
we also noticed an increasing number of certificate sharing among
hosts which do not belong to the same logical entity. Most criti-
cally also among OV certificates where a service provider obtains a
certificate under its name and lists the host name of its customers
as SAN, practically defeating the identification purpose of the cer-
tificate. At the time of writing, for example, we observe cases of
such certificates listing SANs that obviously belong to separate enti-
ties, e.g.,mo.gov ,asap.farm , and incapsula.com under the same
certificate. In this very specific case, records from the Wayback
Machine archives show that asap.farm has previously belonged
to Missouri Department of Agriculture [ 65] but it was never re-
moved from the certificate as the domain name registration was
transferred to another entity.
6.2.4 Certificate Validity. A certificate is presumed valid if, among
others, it is deployed within its validity period, is issued by a trust-
worthy CA, carries a valid signature, is bound to the correct subject
name, and is not revoked (see RFC 5280 [ 26]). Checking revocation
status often requires network transactions, and is the most expen-
sive operation among aforementioned factors. Thus in many cases it
is either performed inadequately or ignored altogether by browsers
(partly in favor of proprietary solutions) [ 57]. Consequently, in the
past years both CAs and browser vendors have been negotiating to
cap and reduce certificate lifetimes [ 38–40] as an effort to reduce
security risks due to misissued or revoked certificates.
As depicted in Figure 8, the lifetime of certificates utilized by
AAs has been constantly decreasing. This trend can partly be at-
tributed to consensus among CAs and browser vendors to reduce
certificate lifetimes, but also due to rising popularity of CAs which
are specialized on free and automated DV certificates such as Let’s
Encrypt (fixed lifetime of 90 days). The median validity periods that
we observe here are comparable with related works [ 21,28], yetMeasuring Namespaces, Web Certificates, and DNSSEC of AA WWW ’21, April 19–23, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia

in validity periods from 2015 on.
7 RELATED WORK
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigat-
ing how Alerting Authorities in the US (as part of broader critical
infrastructure) implement measures to cater for trustworthy Web-
based communication and service provision. Previous research on
trust in online emergency service provision mainly focuses on
form and content and its relation to the perception of trustworthi-
ness [ 17,29,46], conception of trustworthy emergency communica-
tion and collaboration systems [ 18,69] or simply best practices in
building trust [ 10,58]. Although previous research has already high-
lighted how knowing who is behind an online emergency service
impacts the trustworthiness of their respective services [ 29,58,70],
we observe a research gap when it comes to evaluating the mea-
sures at one’s disposal to reach this goal. More specifically, the
interplay of characteristics of domain names and X.509 certificates,
i.e.,Assurance Profile (Section 3). has not been investigated to our
best knowledge. Respectively, we limit ourselves to an overview of
related work which studies these technologies on their own.
Domain Namespace and DNSSEC. The influence of a domain
name on authenticating or at least recognizing the real-world en-
tity behind that name has been investigated in terms of general
trustworthiness associated with TLDs and impersonation of trusted
entities through domain name masquerading. Walther, Wang, and
Loh [ 88] examine how choice of TLD can positively impact the
credibility of health websites. Seckler et al. [81] investigate how a
relevant domain name, e.g.,a known TLD, can positively enforce
familiarity and in turn increase trust. Similarly, a yearly report [ 37]
commissioned by the Public Internet Registry examines the trust-
worthiness of select TLDs among NGO donors.
A closely related topic is how the domain namespace of malicious
websites is structured and operated. Korczynski et al. [53] show
how low pricing and registration barriers alongside the possibility
of bulk registration is an enabler for malicious actors to migrate to
new gTLDs. In a longitudinal study of typosquatting, Agten et al. [4]
reveals how registration fees and registry policies can attract or
deter malicious actors; practically determining the credibility of
such TLDs (the top three most abused TLDs in the world are new
gTLDs [ 72]). And Antonakakis et al. [6] introduce a reputation
system for DNS to detect malicious domain names. Different studies
show how scammers try to impersonate other entities by partly
or fully integrating legitimate domain names in their own domainnames [ 4,52,75,86] or even by using homonymous names using
internationalized domain names [85].
With regard to namespace security, studies in the past pinpoint a
relatively low DNSSEC penetration due to various factors ranging
from lack of support by local resolvers to server misconfigura-
tions [ 22,42,56,68] despite more than 90% of all TLDs being signed
and supporting DNSSEC [ 74]. The prevalence of DNSSEC among
various types of organizations, such as educational, military, com-
mercial, etc.has not been subject of study to determine if there is a
correlation between field of operation and sensibility for DNS secu-
rity measures. The only exception is the fine-grained, i.e.,including
second level domains, regular analysis of DNSSEC deployment
among select governmental agencies within the .gov namespace,
educational institutions, and industry in the US [63, 77].
Web PKI. Throughout the years, various measurements have
characterized X.509 certificates in use over the Internet in terms of
validity, issuing CAs, key strength, etc.[21,28,45,60]. Among these,
Mishari et al. [60] investigate the difference between certificates of
legitimate and fraudulent websites. The study by Holz et al. [45]
has the advantage of being performed from different vantage points
spread over the world. The measurements by Durumeric et al. [28]
is noteworthy as it goes beyond mere X.509 certificate analysis and
investigates the dependencies among root and intermediate CAs,
their market share, and the characteristics of respective certificates.
And finally, the measurements performed by Chung et al. [21] aim
to understand why a majority of certificates advertised over IPv4
are invalid. It should be noted that except the last study, the oth-
ers have been carried out before major changes in the Web PKI
occurred, such as various mergers and the public launch of Let’s En-
crypt [ 2]. Furthermore, the findings from these studies exhibit dif-
ferent characteristics of sample sets, which are either too limited
(e.g.,Alexa Top 1M) or too broad ( e.g.,IPv4 space). Those differ-
ences do not allow for statistical inference and comparison with
our observations.
In a recent study, which is most closely related to our work, Sin-
ganamalla et al. [83] measure the adoption of https at government
websites. Using primarily an automated, keyword-based matching
to collect domain names this approach is prone to false positives
and makes comparison to our work infeasible. Also, this work does
not relate to Assurance Profiles, which we introduce in our study.
Specifically related to the topic of our work are studies which
investigate the trustworthiness of CAs in general and their policies
specially in enabling fraud and impersonation. Delignat-Lavaud et
al.[27], for example, investigate the conformance of CAs to the
CA/Browser Forum guidelines, which in turn can influence trust-
worthiness of a CA. Others have defined various metrics to qual-
ify [19,30] or quantify trustworthiness of CAs [ 43] beyond technical
measures. In a recent study Schwittmann, Wander and Weis [ 80],
similar to Brandt et al. [14], exhibit how various CAs are susceptible
to attacks on DV certification processes that can practically lead to
domain impersonation. Roberts et al. [75] studies which CAs are re-
sponsible for issuing DV certificates to malicious target-embedded
domains.WWW ’21, April 19–23, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia Tehrani et al.
8 KEY FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS
Our results draw a rather alarming picture of the current online
emergency management landscape regarding trustworthy commu-
nication. Along the line of our key findings, we discuss the possible
reasons for the observed deficiencies and suggest alternatives.
Only about 22% of AAs deploy sufficient identification. Iden-
tification, as discussed in Section 3, succeeds over multiple factors,
which are only insufficiently attended to by AAs: only about half of
AAs have their dedicated names and as such cannot obtain exclusive
X.509 certificates as proof of identity (as these are bound to domain
names) while a majority of ≈78%fail to provide any valid certifi-
cate or just DV certificates which lack identification information.
The majority of organizations opt for generic TLDs which simpli-
fies name spoofing and phishing as precursors of impersonation.
Additionally, the minuscule penetration rate of DNSSEC provides
another attack surface by poisoning DNS records and misdirecting
users to malicious websites. Alerting Authorities should at best
be located under restricted namespaces as an additional factor of
recognizably and assurance, have at least their own subdomains
instead of being subsumed in the path segment of a URL, secure
their namespace using DNSSEC, and provide OV/EV certificates as
definitive proof of identity.
Less than 4% of AAs offer secure name resolution. Securing
domain names is seemingly a non-priority for investigated organi-
zations as the low penetration rate of DNSSEC suggests. Insecure
DNS not only can cause misdirection from authentic websites, but
also DV certificate misissuance [ 14,80] which impacts both identi-
fication and session security. Although DNSSEC suffers low deploy-
ment on the global scale in general, it is an indispensable component
in securing emergency communication as part of the broader crit-
ical infrastructure. Yet, it should be noted that in some cases due
to lack of support registrants are forced to abandon DNSSEC in
favor of other factors, e.g.,registering under a .uslocality name for
which there is, surprisingly, no DNSSEC support (see Figure 4). We
also note that although domain names under .gov namespaces are
mandated to use DNSSEC [ 66], the low support for DNSSEC has
its roots in operational and organizational mismanagement rather
than technical issues.
DV certificates dominate transaction security. The popularity
of domain validation certificates combined with low penetration
of DNSSEC represents an attack surface that can compromise ses-
sion security through certificate missisuance and monkey-in-the-
middle attacks. If DV is indispensable for some, we encourage the
stakeholders to reconsider semantically equivalent alternative of
TLSA domain issued certificates (DANE EE) as they provide higher
resilience against spoofing in contrast to DV certificates [ 80]. In
general, DANE can be used to remove ambiguity regarding public
keys and responsible CAs for a domain name [67].
Fate-sharing is on the rise. The lack of dedicated domain names
and an increase of certificate sharing in multitenancy settings rep-
resents worrisome and de facto unnecessary dependencies, which
both can expand the attack surface [ 67] and can cause instabilities
in the future. Regarding shared certificates, we suggest abandoningthem completely and also encourage CAs to avoid issuing OV cer-
tificates for service providers without ensuring that all the listed
subject alternative names belong to the same organization.
Convenience and cost impact security preferences. We ob-
serve 15% of AAs providing none or invalid certificates. This can
be traced back to carelessness regarding the Web PKI trust model
(self-signed certificates) or additional (not only financial) configu-
ration [ 54] and certification costs. Rapid growth of Let’s Encrypt
with its fully automated certificate issuance and renewal is an in-
dication of how the aforementioned factors influence the decision
for choosing an appropriate CA. Similarly, we measure less than
45% represented under restricted namespaces. In contrast to gTLDs,
higher registration fees or bureaucratic hurdles, and longer del-
egation processing times are among discouraging factors, which
call for governmental support and can effectively be addressed
by policy-makers through price caps and easier access for eligible
organizations which fulfill the strict requirements.
Responsibilities beyond Alerting Authorities. The scope of
trustworthy communication goes beyond our investigations and ex-
tends to consumers as well as infrastructure operators such as CAs,
ISPs, and browser vendors. There is still a gap between CA practices
and guidelines [ 27], some automated DV certification services are
susceptible to impersonation attacks [ 75,80], and some root CAs do
not restrict certification scope for their intermediate CAs [ 28]. DNS
registrars not always offer DNSSEC by default or free of cost [ 23]
and only a minority of ISPs bother to operate DNSSEC-aware re-
cursive resolvers that properly verify signed DNS records [22, 89].
Browser vendors should also provide better security usability by
avoiding confusing SSL/TLS warnings [ 5], improve instead of aban-
doning visual cues for different certificate types [ 32,44,64], and
start offering alternative CA trustworthiness assessment measures
beyond the standard binary trust model [ 19,30,43]. Finally, users
should be educated in better understanding the semantics of do-
main names [ 76] and web PKI certificates and their practical use
and ramifications.
9 CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
In this paper, we conceptualized a threat model for trustworthy
communication in emergency management and analyzed the lack of
common technologies, DNS(SEC) and Web PKI, to mitigate threats
to identification, resolution, and content manipulation or eavesdrop-
ping. We provided an overview of how Alerting Authorities (AA)
in the US are structured within the domain namespace, how wide-
spread is DNSSEC in securing their domain names, and how Web
PKI is used for authentication and data security. We uncovered
deficiencies and discussed alternatives while emphasizing that re-
spective solutions are not necessarily technical but operational as
well as political. Protecting critical infrastructure for emergency
communication and public safety entails addressing operational
and policy challenges on national and international levels and calls
for commitment of all stakeholders from service providers to inter-
mediate infrastructure operators and browser vendors alongside
policy-makers.
In the future, this work can be extended beyond the US territory
while providing a comparison basis for other countries. Further-
more, other technologies can be accommodated in our assuranceMeasuring Namespaces, Web Certificates, and DNSSEC of AA WWW ’21, April 19–23, 2021, Ljubljana, Slovenia
profiles. Finally, the role of intermediate infrastructure and further
dependency structures can be investigated in depth.
Data Disclosure. We provide a browser that presents the assurance
profile of each Alerting Authority and additional accompanying
material on https://aa.secnow.net . Our toolchain and collected
data are published under doi:10.5281/zenodo.4300946 .
Ethical Considerations. We informed Alerting Authorities about
their assurance profiles to raise awareness for improvements.
