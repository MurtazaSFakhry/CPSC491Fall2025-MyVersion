As of 2023, there are approximately 20,000 EAS participants nationwide.\n\n2. **EAS Encoder/Decoder Equipment**: Devices that receive, process, and retransmit alert messages. The FCC mandated upgrades to CAP-capable equipment in 2012 (FCC 07-219).\n\n3. **Primary Entry Point (PEP) Stations**: 77 radio stations designated by FEMA to serve as the backbone of the national alert system. These receive alerts directly from FEMA's IPAWS system.\n\n4. **State and Local Primary (LP) Stations**: Regional stations that distribute alerts within their coverage areas, following the EAS Protocol specified in State EAS Plans.\n\n5. **IPAWS Integration**: Since 2012, EAS has been integrated with the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), which uses the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) standard for message distribution.\n\n6. **SAME Codes**: Specific Area Message Encoding codes that target alerts to precise geographic regions using FIPS codes.\n\nAccording to a 2023 FCC report, the system successfully distributes approximately 50,000 state and local emergency alerts annually, with a 99.8% reliability rate for National Periodic Tests."}]}

In 2020, she developed the Warning Analytics Platform, which analyzes social media responses to emergency alerts. Her 2019 study published in the International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction found that alerts with specific protective actions increased compliance by 67%.\n\n2. **Dr. Dennis Mileti** (Professor Emeritus, University of Colorado): Pioneer in warning system research since 1975. His seminal 1999 book \"Disasters by Design\" established the framework for effective warning message design. The FCC cited his research in developing WEA character limits.\n\n3. **Dr. Betty Pfefferbaum** (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center): Research focuses on psychological impacts of emergency alerts. Her 2014 study in the Journal of Traumatic Stress examined alert fatigue, finding that over-alerting reduced response rates by 42%.\n\n4. **Dr. Brian Wolshon** (Louisiana State University): Transportation and evacuation expert. His 2020 NSF-funded study analyzed traffic patterns during hurricane evacuations triggered by WEA alerts in Florida, documenting evacuation times and routes.\n\nAccording to a 2023 bibliometric analysis published in Safety Science, these researchers account for 38% of citations in emergency alerting literature."}]}
