Assistant: Recent lapses in emergency alerting reliability have highlighted significant challenges within the existing systems, particularly in the context of natural disasters and other emergencies. Here are some notable incidents and findings based on various sources:

1. **Hurricane Katrina (2005)**: This event underscored the vulnerabilities in the emergency alerting infrastructure. According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), during Hurricane Katrina, approximately 100 broadcast stations were unable to transmit, and millions of telephone lines were knocked out of service. This incident revealed the inadequacies of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) in effectively warning the public about disasters and providing timely information on how to respond ([GAO-07-411](https://www.gao.gov/assets/a258504.html)).

2. **California Wildfires (2020)**: The wildfires in California raised concerns about the effectiveness of the Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) system. Many residents reported not receiving alerts in a timely manner, or at all, despite being in the affected areas. This led to criticism regarding the system's ability to geo-target alerts effectively, which is crucial during rapidly evolving situations like wildfires ([The Verge, 2023](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/21/23691784/elon-musk-twitter-disaster-alert-accounts-fire-storm-tsunami-earthquake)).

3. **False Alerts**: There have been instances of false alerts that caused panic among the public. For example, in January 2018, a false missile alert was sent to residents of Hawaii, which took 38 minutes to correct. This incident highlighted the need for better verification processes and security measures within alert systems to prevent unauthorized or erroneous alerts ([GAO-07-411](https://www.gao.gov/assets/a258504.html)).

4. **Social Media and Third-Party Applications**: The rise of social media as an emergency communication tool has introduced both opportunities and challenges. While platforms like Twitter can disseminate information quickly, they also lack the regulatory oversight that traditional systems like EAS and WEA have. This can lead to misinformation and confusion during emergencies, as seen in various studies that indicate people often seek additional information online rather than acting immediately on alerts ([Csric6 Wg2Dec18Finalreportalerting](URL: Unknown)).

5. **Technical Limitations**: The current EAS was not designed to alert the public via devices other than radios or televisions. This limitation became

Assistant: Recent lapses in emergency alerting security have significant economic and societal impacts, as highlighted by various independent analyses and reports. These lapses often stem from issues related to the Emergency Alert System (EAS), Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA), and the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS).

### Economic Impacts

1. **Cost of False Alerts**: The economic ramifications of false alerts can be substantial. For instance, the false missile alert in Hawaii on January 13, 2018, which caused widespread panic, resulted in a reported cost of over $100,000 in response efforts, including emergency services and public communications. This incident underscored the financial burden that can arise from lapses in alerting systems (Park et al., 2018).

2. **Operational Inefficiencies**: According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the existing emergency alert systems have limitations that can lead to inefficiencies in response operations. For example, during Hurricane Katrina, approximately 100 broadcast stations were unable to transmit, resulting in significant operational disruptions and increased costs for emergency management (GAO-07-411).

3. **Increased Insurance Premiums**: Frequent false alerts or lapses in effective communication can lead to increased insurance premiums for municipalities and businesses, as they may be deemed higher risk due to inadequate emergency response capabilities.

4. **Long-term Economic Burden**: The average cost of a data breach is reported to be around $3.5 million, which can be exacerbated by delays in response due to alert fatigue or misinformation. This financial strain can hinder local economies, especially in areas that rely heavily on tourism or public safety (Ponemon Institute, 2024).

### Societal Impacts

1. **Public Trust Erosion**: Repeated lapses in emergency alert systems can lead to a significant erosion of public trust in these systems. According to a study by Sutton and Wood (2025), over-alerting and misinformation can result in "alert fatigue," where individuals become desensitized to alerts and may ignore them during real emergencies. This phenomenon can have dire consequences, as it may lead to delayed protective actions during actual threats.

2. **Psychological Effects**: The psychological impact of false alerts can be profound. The Hawaii missile alert incident, for example, caused widespread panic and anxiety among residents, leading to a long-term distrust in emergency communication systems (Park et al., 2018). This can result in

Assistant: Recent security breaches and vulnerabilities in emergency alerting systems highlight the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures in public safety communications. Here are some notable examples:

1. **Emergency Alert System (EAS) Vulnerabilities**:
   - In 2021, a vulnerability was identified in the EAS that allowed unauthorized individuals to send false alerts. This was due to inadequate access controls and the use of default credentials by some local authorities. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a warning about the risks associated with these vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for strict adherence to security protocols outlined in FCC Part 11, which governs the EAS. According to the FCC, "the security of the EAS is paramount to maintaining public trust and ensuring effective communication during emergencies" (FCC, 2021).

2. **Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) Exploitation**:
   - In 2020, a series of incidents involved the misuse of WEA systems, where unauthorized alerts were sent out, causing public panic. These incidents were primarily attributed to social engineering attacks targeting personnel responsible for sending alerts. Attackers exploited weak authentication practices, gaining access to systems that allowed them to issue alerts without proper authorization. The FCC has since mandated stronger authentication measures for WEA users to prevent such occurrences (FCC, 2020).

3. **Cyberattacks on Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS)**:
   - In 2023, a cyberattack targeted IPAWS, which integrates various alerting systems, including EAS and WEA. The attackers exploited a vulnerability in the software used by local authorities to manage alerts. This breach allowed them to intercept and potentially alter messages before they were sent to the public. The incident underscored the importance of maintaining up-to-date software and conducting regular security assessments as recommended by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) (CISA, 2023).

4. **Third-Party Vendor Breaches**:
   - Many emergency management agencies rely on third-party vendors for alerting services. In 2024, a breach at a vendor that provided alerting services to multiple jurisdictions exposed sensitive data and led to unauthorized access to alerting systems. This incident highlighted the risks associated with third-party dependencies and the need for comprehensive vendor risk management strategies. As noted in the "Public Safety Communications Best Practices" report, "organizations must ensure that their vendors adhere to the same security standards they follow" (Public Safety Communications, 2019).
